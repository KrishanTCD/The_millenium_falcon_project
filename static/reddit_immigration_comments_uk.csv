2. Want to learn more about domestic ducks? Please take a look at our [complete guide to duck care](https://www.reddit.com/r/duck/wiki/careguide). This guide explains how to meet all your ducks' welfare needs. 

3. If you're thinking about helping a wild duck, or have already rescued a duck, please read our [guide to duck rescue](http://reddit.com/r/duck/wiki/rescueadvice). Most importantly, you should always get advice from a wildlife rehabilitator before interfering with wildlife. If you already have a wild duck in your care, please [contact a wildlife rehabilitator](http://reddit.com/r/duck/wiki/rescueadvice#wiki_2._how_to_rescue_a_wild_duck) **ASAP** -- you cannot care for the duck on your own.

gender identity is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms
[**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/) than that, but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal
infants. And sometimes, the gender identity expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearnce. The
gender identities of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958)
as those of [**cisgender children**](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).

Regarding treatment for trans youth, [**here**](http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf)
are the recent guidelines released by the AAP. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender identity, and
some of those young kids are trans. A child whose gender identity is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their
appearance, will suffer debilitating distress over this conflict. 

When this happens, transition is the treatment recommended by every major medical authority. For young children this process is
social, followed by puberty delaying treatment at onset of adolescence, and hormone therapy in their early/mid-teens.


The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and
depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext),
and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375/).
When prevented from transitioning, about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition, that rate drops to
the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical
treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are [**comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958).

Transition [**vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts**](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2),
and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets. The ability to transition, along with family and
social acceptance, are the [**largest factors reducing suicide risk**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/)

2024-04-11 14:59:12,kz32rng,"I haven't read the report, but I've downloaded it and when I have time to read \~350 pages I fully intend to.

However, the one thing that I have taken from a quick skim so far seems quite positive. One of the conclusions seems to be that there essentially has not been enough research, funding and provision of trans healthcare in the UK, which is absolutely true. Trans people have been completely let down by the health system trying to ignore them for decades, and now when forced to look into it, it should come as no surprise that research and funding are severely lacking. OP, if you've read it and I have got the wrong end of the stick on this, I'm happy to be corrected.

If the outcome of this is that trans healthcare is actually prioritised, funded and properly researched - so long as it's done fairly and transparently with the patients' best interests at heart - then long-term that should be a big win. Of course short-term it gives them an excuse to pull puberty blockers and other medical interventions, which clearly sucks and doesn't help the people who need help right now. And knowing this country, it will take years and years to actually get anywhere, by which time so many current young trans people will have gone through their AGAB puberty, so I recognise that there are still big drawbacks. But the long-term spotlight on proper research is a glimmer of hope.",jesuisnick

2024-04-11 15:19:36,kz36fuk,"For me, the ads only worked with higher-priced products of around $300 or more. They didn't work at all for products under $50. There needs to be enough margin to pay for the ads.

Also, I sold niche branded products where people searched for those brands. My keywords targetted the brand names. I didn't run ads for the generic product name because they didn't work. You need to target keywords that show some buying intent.

I didn't sell kettles but will us them as an example. If people search for ""kettle"", they're not usually ready to buy. They don't even know what kettle they want. They're generally just look at different sites. Those keywords will cost a lot per click but you're rarely get a buyer.

After looking around, they may decide they want a Kenwood kettle, so they'll search for that. Those keywords will be a little cheaper and you'll get some buyers.

But when they start searching for things like ""Kenwood 1.5 liter black kettle"", they're at the stage where they know what they want and are ready to buy. These are the keywords to bid for. I bid on hundreds of combinations. The ads are much cheaper because most sellers don't do the work to target longtail keywords.

You cou,d pay $0.20 to bid on ""Kenwood 1.5 liter blaxk kettle"" and be in position 1. A competitor could pay $2 in position 2 because they bid on ""Kenwood kettle"" broad match.

This is how you get ad costs down to a minimum. You also need to keep testing different ad copy. Just changing the wording a little can double sales on an ad.

I woukd suggest only targetting your home country, at least to begin with. If you target other countries, people will click yheads but not buy because they don't want to order from overseas. If you do target other countries, you should run different ad groups for each country otherwise you'll never knkw what works and what doesn't.

You shoukd never ynrow up generic ads for generic products. Ads need to be precisely targetted. And clicks shoukd go yhrough to the product page not the home page or category page. If someone clicks on an ad for Kenwood 1.5 liter black kettle, you shoukd send them to the exact page. If they land somewhere else they will click away. They wang to buy a specific product not hunt around the website for it.

Hope this helps.

Oh, finally, I didn't start with $3k a month of ads. I started with oneset of ads for one product. Start slowly and cheaply and check stats a few times a day and adjust accordingly.",sidehustle2025

the UK and the USA have reciprocal visa arrangements but he still needs to meet the criteria. his upcoming trial may well put a stop to him coming here. it’s also a very different thing entering as a tourist and entering to work.

edit to add: as a ‘creative’ Bam could get a temporary work visa but he would need to be sponsored, apply 3 months in advance and meet the eligibility criteria.

if he comes in as a tourist and engages in paid work he could be in a lot of trouble. i don’t doubt that he’s just going to try to wing it, but as someone with an international profile i would be very surprised indeed if he wasn’t asked if he was intending to engage in paid work whilst 8’ the UK. advertising gigs with a ticket price is going to be hard to explain away.",BINGGBONGGBINGGBONGG

I assume that you have no other paths for migration open besides those that are based on jobs.

Typically it is easier to get visa sponsoring jobs in EU, UK for people in specific fields ( like tech), usually masters and few years of experience. Such individuals have the highest chance of getting such visas. 

Alternatively you can try to see if you can find a job in US that have offices abroad and transfer there. 

There is no particular country in Western Europe where your chances of getting visa sponsoring job based on your skills are substantially better. I guess, bigger country would have bigger labor market. You are majoring in Economics, you know how those things work.

Use the calculator to measure yourself, start with that size and adjacent sizes (like a cup size up and down), stick with unlined seamed bras, get the same style bra so you can compare. When it seems too big but the next size down is too small, probably a shape issue. Come back here with details on how it's going to get advice for what to try next. 

It took me over a year of on and off searching, but I eventually found my size and preferred brand.

Would suggest you run the numbers through some mortgage calculators to understand how much the increase would be and what that does to the mortgage free timeline, there's a compromise in there somewhere.

If wfh is untenable you should run the numbers on your increased commute costs and the other incidentals that come with being in office more (increased spends on clothing, lunch food, etc.)",Wonderful-Matter4274

To some extent, no one location will have all the things you need. It might have all the things you need today, but needs will always change as time goes by.

I’m looking for an admittedly sport not classic second hand mini currently after being badly burnt by an older, low mileage one.  I’m not going older than 2018 and no higher mileage than 40k. 

The cars I’m looking at are £12-18k

If she’s looking for a cheap small car she’s better going with a fiat 500, Aygo or Citroen C1.  Minis are great little cars but older ones can be unreliable due to bad maintenance and repairs are very expensive.  You can also struggle to find a mechanic for older ones as in my experience they will refuse to work on them unless theyre an enthusiast themselves.

The city is solid orange for ANDP but its the gateway to the North so there is always O+G opportunities and government jobs, river valley is a real treasure, great restaurants, and lots of smaller communities close to the city for a little cheaper housing if you want to commute. ",Photofug

2024-04-11 14:16:48,kz2vbz7,"Of your 3 main options I'd say Edmonton is definitely your best fit. Edmonton is the only consistent NDP hold out in Alberta so socially you may like that more. Edmonton is also the city of festivals with 3-4 things going on every weekend during the summer and 1-2 during winter usually. It's stuttered a bit post covid but it's picking up again. All of healthcare in Alberta is suffering right now. Edmonton at least has options, where as Lethbridge and med hat have limited locations and specialists. Weather wise for migraines I'd check around. I've gotten maybe 4-5 migraines a year here, about half as much as in Calgary. I've not been in Lethbridge or med hat long enough to notice migraine trends. In my opinion, in very broad strokes, Lethbridge and med hat are very white and religious spots. They both are close to hutterite and Mennonite communities. Not a bad thing just worth noting. 
Anywhere in Alberta will have frigid temps during winter, there's no getting away from that. But redeems itself with the so many sunny days. 
Edmonton airport is international but not a ton of variety of international flights. I think they do have direct to UK though. 

Hope this helps!",SuchAGeoNerd
2024-04-11 14:17:12,kz2veij,"Edmonton.

The same as Calgary but a little friendlier, more events/festivals, more multicultural/expats.
Two of my best friends growing up were UK expats (Coalchester and Edinburgh). Their parents definitely had British communities. 

The problem with Edmonton right now is that it is on the same trajectory as Calgary was last year. Low inventory, high demand. Houses are going to go up for a while.

I've lived in Edmonton, Lethbridge, Vancouver, Kelowna and now Calgary. 

Edmonton and Calgary have pretty similar weather. Calgary gets way more snow and has a shorter frost free season as it's higher elevation. Edmonton used to be colder, but the winters go up and down the same really now.

Lethbridge is a university town that's half Mormon. When I was there in school it was much less progressive than it is now, with more to do. The weather is extreme. The wind can take chimneys off houses. Crazy hot in summer, 50 degree temp swings in winter in a Chinook. Chinooks are where migraines live.

I would like to point out AB is much more expensive than interior BC now, outside housing in some places, but Calgary is comparable to Vermon and Penticton now it seems. The bills (taxes, insurance, utilities) much higher here. We're paying $300 plus more a month (mortgage the same). As crazy as that is, when we left AB was the land of expendable money. Not anymore. But it pays trades way better, if either of you are in trades.

Oh the condo fees in AB are astronomical (strata), so try to steer clear of those.

ETA Calgarians hate Edmonton with their being, so you'll probably get negative comments, just ask them how much actual time they've spent in Edmonton and make your assessment.",pinupbob
