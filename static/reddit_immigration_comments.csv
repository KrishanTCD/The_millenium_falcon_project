If your parents and grandparents were born in the USA, you’re likely unable to have additional nationalities, with some exceptions. 

Even if you do marry a foreign national, immigration paperwork is HARD. 

I’m saying this as the foreign national (in this context) who married an American here. We’ve known each other for six years, our relationship accelerated over last two, now we are wearing matching rings as of Leap Day.

The paperwork we need to produce is kinda ridiculous. Proof of travel to each other and together. Photos. Chat records. Wedding photos. Police certificates (FBI NOLO letter). 

Even then it’ll take a few months for them to get the base medical clearance (for spouses, they can’t have TB or HIV) and biometrics done.",aphroditex
2024-04-07 19:24:26,kyiftf1,San Francisco Bay is probably your best bet. I don't think there's any place on earth safer for us. Unless you're rich Europe is pretty trash for us healthcare wise.

2024-04-07 23:03:59,kyjfmbn,"I'd move to San Francisco or Las Angeles, or honestly stay in NYC. Leaving the US is extremely hard and not that realistic without a college degree in a very important field (science, medicine, law, teaching, etc. ) (It also costs a ton of money to make the move, and unless you marry someone from that country, you'll need to get a work visa which is very hard to do.)

San Francisco is the most lgbt friendly city in the US, and California is the safest state for LGBT people. (Hawaii is also very safe and it's rarely ever cold there, so that's an option.) I have never experienced any hate while living here in the SF Bay Area, so I know you'll have a much better and safer life here, or moving to Las Angeles or San Diego. Trust me on this when I say San Francisco, California is so safe I almost forget my friends in other US states have to hide their pride pins when walking to and from school. (I'm just so used to the culture in SF that I forget I'm just hella lucky and not everyone in the US has this amount of safety.)

If you really do feel the need to leave the US, and snow is a big issue for you, most of Europe is out of the question. The majority of Africa is unsafe for trans people, aside from South Africa, so you may want to avoid moving there. Israel is pretty safe for trans people, but they aren't safe in terms of constant bombs and violent neighboring countries, and moving there as a non-jew is hard. Australia is always an option, although it's really hard to move all the way there, it does snow and is home to the most venomous animals out of any continent. New Zealand is also a very safe option, but they also snow in the winter, so honestly I'd just stay in the US because as long as you live in a very liberal state you'll be okay.",Comprehensive_Fox_79

You speak English and have been exposed at least somewhat to Hollywood and social media to understand some parts of American culture, laws etc. That is not often the case in reverse

Yes I had free universal healthcare as a citizen, but I couldn't set up an appointment with my insurance funded doctor as the app was in the local language so I would pay $30 each time to visit an urgent care that was geared towards tourists so they all spoke English. 

Gatekeeping HRT is annoying for the locals, but I knew as soon as my egg cracked that I had no chance of passing all of the hurdles when I couldn't even understand what the sale sign in the grocery store says.

While the ceremony itself is performed in India as well, it looks like Texas State has laws against using hot tools such as the one used here. The article mentions that the kid wasn't aware of exactly what would be used.

Perhaps the temple Trust (which administered the ceremony) wasn't aware of the local laws either. Also, it's weird why 12 year old kids are allowed to undergo this ceremony. The ceremony signifies accepting Vishnu as the true God and taking a vow to abide by the Vaishnava philosophy. It makes no sense to include kids here as they're too young to understand any of this.

The allegation that you didn't know what was happening is ridiculous. Before the ceremony starts the ""Acharya"" explains the steps and procedures.

COVID was deflationary not inflationary. The inflation came from government spending. Trump did spend 3 T in his last year on COVID but he had the advantage of the deflation from covid. Biden has spent more in his first 3 years than Trump did in all 4 of his years and Biden has 0 deflationary factors to offset his spending.

Lol yeah regular Americans need to stop being selfish about gas prices because Putin. An increase in supply from the keystone pipeline would have absolutely affected gas prices, that's basic supply and demand. 

The US first became energy independent under Trump and Biden has barely continued that.

https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/imports-and-exports.php

The tax bill had to go through reconciliation or else the Democrats would have filibustered it. This forced the tax cuts for individuals to be temporary instead of permanent. The individual tax cuts will be renewed and even made permanent if not filibuster by the Democrats again.

The ""border security bill"" is actually called the foreign aid bill. Adding earmarks to bills and criticizing the other side for not passing them is the oldest trick in the book. It's actually sad that this tactic still works on leftist voters. 🤣

Plus the bill is horrible, it allows 5,000 illegal migrants per day. 

I love when the left brings up the 91 indictments. It shows two things. First how un-American the left are, they don't believe in the presumption of innocence, a core value in the judicial branch.

I'm here to debate about our energy policies, not politics.

Biden has been dumping our oil reserves to keep gasoline prices from rising. Our SPR levels haven't been this low since we created it in the 1980s.

https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=mcsstus1&f=m

We have less Oil rigs available for production than before covid started. Covid started in November 2019. Oil rig count collapsed during covid, then slowly built itself back up. Still less than before covid started.

If we have so much energy, then why did Biden banned the export of liquidfied natural gas? 

https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/us-halt-on-lng-exports-presents-new-opportunity-for-canada

If we have so much excess natural gas that we can't sell it all, why did Biden trapped natural gas in the US? Is it to protect domestic supply? 

40% of electricity comes from natural gas.

https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/use-of-natural-gas.php#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20accounted%20for%20about,by%20all%20sectors%20in%202022.

Producers use a lot of energy to make things. If their energy cost goes up, then they need to raise prices. If prices goes up, inflation goes up. If inflation goes up, then wages goes up. 

Since 2021, the FED has been calling inflation transitory. Meaning it's temporary. Fast forward to 2024, inflation is not transitory. 

https://thehill.com/business/4529787-yellen-regrets-saying-inflation-transitory/amp/

If you think inflation is bad now. You haven't seen SHIT! When you manipulate the energy markets, piss off your middle east energy allies, https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/08/saudi-arabia-cut-oil-production/

Staring a war in the middle east with Israel, multiple countries threatening war with each other, supply disruption, etc, you'll be wishing to come back to this time. Oil just reached $90 a barrel, and it's only spring. I'm sure Biden will do something to prevent it from going too high. It's election season after all. Voters are stupid and see high gasoline and think who ever is president is to be blamed. 

The whole reason why the US became the world police is because the US made a deal with the rest of the world in the 1980s that we will patrol the sea for supply distribution. Countries didn't need to invest in their own military to protect shipments.",Virtual_Rest_700

The unemployment rate has also been under 4% for 26 months straight under Biden compared to 13 months under Trump. The highest unemployment rate under Trump was 14.7% compared to 6.3% under Biden.

I take it that you don't understand that massive infrastructure changes do not just happen overnight. That lots of planning and repreparations must take place before shovel meets dirt.

As for the money earmarked for the changeover, most of it hasnt even been touched yet. Its just sitting there waiting for people to apply for whichever tax credits/deductions/rebates/programs that fits their needs. 
  You're probably correct that some has been mismanaged.

Paxlovid is a drug, a treatment for Covid, not a vaccine.  

An informed person would know this.

“I'm not sure what you're talking about unemployment rate is currently 3.9%”

That’s because you’ve never heard of the term “real unemployment,” because you’re not as informed as you think you are.

“Again sorry if you're having trouble but I don't them trump would just magically fix that for you when he didn't before.”

I’m not struggling.  I’m debt free except for my mortgage and have five years of living expenses in the bank.  I also haven’t missed a day of work due to lack of work in my career of 27 years.  I just empathize with those who are struggling and I’m not so stupid/brainwashed/uniformed to think that the unemployment numbers published by the government actually mean anything.  Again, you’re not as informed as you think.

And btw, I’m not voting for Trump and I don’t watch Fox.

“Biden got handed a mess for sure.. a totally incompetent handling of covid by trump cause hundreds of thousands of deaths in this country!“

Do you mean we shouldn’t have had travel restrictions to and from China as early as we like Biden wanted to?

Or do you mean we shouldn’t have taken the vaccine as early as we did like Biden consistently suggested?

“I hope at some point you die hards for trump snap out of it. Nobody care everybody got duped by him.”

HYSA are not good, it locks up your money and you lose opportunity cost. It's better to put it into a growth asset that yields more when you're young because you still have a bit of a safety net. Often the HYSA is less than inflation which ultimately you'd be losing buying power. Right now, depending on the country, you'd be losing quite a bit of buying power to inflation. Eg in Australia inflation is about 7.5% and HYSA are giving 5.5%. 

HYSA are generally used by HNW or UHNW individuals that need to hold a large sum of my for a short period of time for some reason, most likely business or something like construction. They give them preferential rates as opposed to the normal person because the large influx of capital allows the bank to loan it back out at a higher rate of interest that that pay the person. I have relatives that are HNM and UHNW who would do this. Its a defensive strategy for people who have already accumulated wealth.",yamborghini

Reviewing resume: I'd only do that for someone very close to me. Considering there are so many online sources, if you want to make it in tech, I'd expect you to learn to do that by yourself.

2024-04-06 18:57:26,kyczxj7,"You should need individuals giving you advice. Here how I should have approached it but did not and wasted couple years of my life.  

Resume:
* Choose 2 field in tech. For example QA Analyst or backend developer.
* Write 2 different resume
* Get sample resume from online. It is hard now a days to get that. I use to use craigslist.
* Write a resume very specific to that field. Ensure you have the key words. You need to learn to identify key words in that tech field them use them in resume.

Bad resume advice:
* Fresh graduates resume should be 1 page => 1 page resume will be picked up by search engine. No one will look at it.

Resume secret:
* Fake it till you make it. If you write you are a fresh graduate the chances of you being hired is very very low. You need to put in experience (NOT college projects) real or fake. Employers don't even consider anyone without 2-3 year of experience.

Interview prep:
* Interview questions: For tech work most of the interview questions are found in www.fullstack.cafe. Keep in mind these questions will not help if you don't go into deep research. You need to research and gain deep knowledge.
* LeetCode: If you are going for developer jobs then you need to do https://leetcode.com/ and start practicing interview coding problems and be good at it. Keep in mind only top 10 companies with good compensation package will go after advance coding problems. If you even gain control of the basic ones you should land a job.

Networking: The word was confusing at first. But it is simply desi style todbeer. Basically start connecting to manager level people in your social circle. Call them once a month and create a deeper bond. Then ask them to help you find a job.

Code repository portfolio: Make sure you build a codebase repository in something like github or gitlabs. I can help review it if you like. You need to showcase your coding capability.

If not, take actions, by making the TV  working a bit worse. You can mess with quite a lot of settings on a modern TV. Wait a month 


3. Take her phone, and subscribe her to a bunch of channels like Vox, which make videos about nonpolitical topics, as well as, political ones. Like a few videos and watch together an unrelated documentary by one of these channels, to prime her and the YouTube algorithm. Wait a month 


4. Check up on her, and if that didn't do the trick, go to watch history, assess, what went wrong and repeat steps 2-3.

I mean this with all respect. Your mom is really going to need a lot of understanding and careful management in the future. As with most of America, I really don't know who will win the 2024 Presidential Election. But I know this. I will NEVER vote for someone who uses hate, racism, misogony, and routinely advocates violence as a methog to garner votes. 

To be clear. The other side is far from perfect. But here is the difference. Biden has never threatend anyone (except for Iran and North Korea) with ""dire"" consequences. Biden and multiple Democrats in and out of congress, has done a lot in an effort to make peoples lives better. Bumpy road to say the least. But at least he and his administration are working toward a goal that will benifit people. 

The U.S. currently has the strongest economies in the world. Inflation rate is dropping, employment rate lowest in nearly 10 years, and health insurance is now available to 44 million new policy holders. You can't be denied health coverage due to pre-existing conditions, and prescription drug prices are beginning to be negotiated by Medicare. Is the system completely perfect - nope. But here is the point. It's getting there.

Regarding your mom. Gently try to steer her away from the MAGA news sources. Don't argue. Don't raise your voice. MAGA feeds on fear. Fear of ""the other people."" Fear of anything and everything that ""is different."" Fear that ""they"" are going take away our guns.

If I was able to move away and support myself on my own, I would have done so and cut all ties with my parents because thanks to the cult of Trump, they’ve changed so drastically from the kind, intelligent people they were 15 years ago. I’m currently in the hospital awaiting placement in a mental health facility, and my mother (who’s a retired adult psych NP) texted the rest of my family to tell them how crazy I am and made it all about her because I told her she was one of my triggers and she was toxic.. So I truly feel all alone and now lost, as I’m not sure I’ll have a place or even any family once I get out of the hospital..

If you can vote in the state elections then how do they determine which state elections you vote in?

Do you know how some states prior to losing reproductive rights would have abortion cut off regardless of what was happening?

Some states left that up to the doctor and patient to decide if there was a life-threatening emergency.

Nobody could walk into a Planned Parenthood and have an abortion at seven months, but if you were seven months along and you were dying from a complication you and your doctor could discuss it and decide whether they want to save your life or the fetus.

I won’t get into the causes of that, because there are many … it is not *just* Fox News or Facebook. I actually think the polar opposite sides agree on what the problems are (gross inequality), but we disagree on “who is unequal” and we disagree on how to go about improving it.

2024-04-07 19:28:40,kyigj9o,"I've gone through this with my mom and stepdad. They were big supporters of Bush Jr. and then became absolutely insane when Trump came on the scene. Every conversation turned to politics and usually ended up angry. 

My mom and I got into it over the abortion issue at one point. I reminded her that the reason I am so pro a woman's right to choose is because that was drilled into my head as a child. She told me horror stories about girls she knew who died in back alley abortions. When I reminded her of that, she confirmed that she did know girls who had died, but she still thought abortion should be completely illegal. I couldn't believe my ears.

Everything came to a breaking point for me when my mom casually mentioned that she had almost died a few months before and was in the hospital for a couple of weeks. I was terrified at the thought of losing her, but also furious that no one in my family had bothered to call and inform me -- especially if they thought she might die. When I pressed her on it her whole response was ""What was I supposed to do? I was in the hospital."" I was like, that was months ago you say and if you didn't know that no one contacted me, you do now and you don't seem upset by that information. I live in California and my family is in Indiana, and my parents had retired to Florida so we are on opposite coasts. 

I just found out a few days ago that my stepdad passed away about 2 weeks ago. I found out because my partner went to his Facebook page to see if he was sharing the newest MAGA conspiracy theory and found people posting his obituary. I was gobsmacked. I knew that they were all in for Trump, but I guess that includes cutting her son out of her life since he's a lifelong gay, liberal, independent man.

Brace yourself, because as stupid and frankly evil as such a policy position is that's precisely what the ""default"" Democrat position is these days. Boomer mom is wrong to demand that you vote for Trump or really anyone at all, but she is right about this one thing. 

When asked where the restrictions should start the talking point is increasingly that they will not get in between a woman and her doctor. They are also opposed to laws requiring medical assistance to be given to babies who are alive after botched abortion. The Democrat line is that there is to be no regulation whatsoever. In their world [Kermit Gosnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_Gosnell) would not have been jailed over any late term abortions. His elective late term abortions and infanticide would be perfectly legal. 

Given a binary/no-compromises choice between a 6 week ban (with health exceptions) and people like Kermit Gosnell being allowed to roam free I think most morally decent people would choose the 6 week ban. Thing is not all people are morally decent and most people are ignoramuses. They just do not know how bad the Democrats are on this. Some moderates have tried to find a middle ground consensus that most can live with but the demagogues go right after them.

I’m not saying to not vote, just vote for something you feel wholesome about.

Dualistic thought lead us to this two party system. It works because citizens have been indoctrinated into believing it’s the only way. John Adams warned against this and it’s literally broke the constitution “a division of the republic into two great parties … is to be dreaded as the great political evil.”

Admittedly, their case was a little different because they have never lived in the U.S., being born to a German father and American mother.

I understand that American elections have international ramifications, but the idea of elections in my eyes boils down to ""The subjects of a government choosing the leaders of that government"". You are technically still a ""subject"" in that you're a citizen, but you don't live there and if you're anything like my German-American friend, you do not pay taxes to the U.S. nor do you receive any benefits from the U.S.",ExtremeWorkinMan

2024-04-06 04:38:54,kya4io9,"I'm sorry that your mom is putting so much pressure on you to vote for Trump.  I guess I understand.  There are so many people who have been manipulated by the media and think Trump is the criminal.  Meanwhile Biden has been influence peddling for decades and who knows what other crimes he's committed.

Honestly I think they'll rig the election again for Biden.  I think this county is gone.  It will be a slow process but eventually the democrats will seize all the weapons and kill anyone who won't surrender their guns and then there will only be one party.  It will move to a full dictatorship as all Socialist/Communist countries do and by the time the sheeple realize what is happening, it will be too late and they won't be ABLE to leave.  So you're lucky you have the dual citizenship.  You can probably bail out before things get too bad.

I suppose it's ""possible"" that if enough people DON'T vote for Biden, Trump could win because they won't be able to print enough ballots in time to convince the public that Biden won fair and square.  I mean most of the country thinks the 2020 election was rigged right now, they just don't think there is anything they can do about it.... so why would the democrats not cheat again?  So like I said.... lost cause.

At any rate.... I cut my family loose a long time ago... not for politics but I'm better off without them.  I have people whom I love and are like family to me.  Better than my real family.

Do what you think is best.... but please, if I can give you any advice.... Do not believe the MSM.  They have no interest in your well being.  They are there to distract you and make money.  They are NOT journalists.  BTW... I have a degree in Radio and Television so I know what I'm talking about.

2024-04-06 10:22:43,kyayk0l,">... we would have to renounce our citizenship to become Americans, but that's an American rule that's not very common globally.

There is no regulation under US law that requires people to renounce any prior citizenship in order to acquire American citizenship. I worked in immigration and citizenship acquisition for the US government. *Other countries* have requirements barring dual citizenship, and if they catch you with a US passport and your home country's passport, then you're in trouble (Japan is like this, and I believe India and China also have similar rules, as did Germany, though they now allow dual citizenship in certain cases). Likewise, if you want to naturalize as a citizen of one of these countries, they will often require proof that you have renounced your US citizenship in order to finalize your naturalization. I know this because I worked in a country where this was the case, and it was always a balancing act to make sure that no one wound up stateless (i.e. they give up their US passport, then randomly get denied their new country's citizenship).

Many people *assume* that when they take up US citizenship, they automatically gave up their former citizenship (I have an uncle who was under this impression), but that is not the case. The US government isn't contacting other governments saying, ""Hey, BTW, So-and-So acquired US citizenship, better shred their Japanese passport!"" The new US citizen has to contact their country of origin to renounce if that's something they can and want to do (some countries, such as Iran, will not allow you to give up their citizenship even if you'd like to).",Diplogeek

It varies by state, but I'm from Michigan, so mine will invite me to local, state, and federal. Then for whichever ones I chose, they will mail me an absentee voter ballot, and I have to fill it out and mail it back quickly. I usually have 2 weeks or less to get it back to them by the deadline.

I also filled out a form a few years ago stating that I wanted to be added permanently to an absentee voter list or something? So they always ask me which ones I want to vote on during election time instead of me needing to request one.

The ironic part was that her husband is an orthopedic surgeon, he didn’t even send her to the doctor he just told her that was pregnancy and to suck it up it was normal why is she complaining.

Once she had the baby they checked her out and at that point the spinal cancer was so progressed she had to wear a back brace because her spine was falling apart, she only lived until the baby was about two months old.

IF she had gone to the doctor and they had figured terminating the pregnancy would allow her to have cancer treatments, some states would have allowed her to decide to go ahead and have the cancer treatments regardless of how far along the fetus is.

Some states would decide she has to die because the fetus is past the point where she can save her own life.

Mind you, this aunt, while a multimillionaire, still didn’t have enough to be afforded much benefit from Trump’s time in office.

Plump said if he was reelected it would be permanent. Then Biden waived any missed payroll taxes so nobody would have to come up with a lump sum in January

So listen if you were one of those people who had payroll taxes withheld at the end of 2020 your boss did not have to send them to the government. Biden waived that. We should be able to get that back.

I didn’t say anything because I’m a disabled person who works part time so there was a total of maybe three dollars withheld from me. Maybe my boss sent it in anyway even though it wasn’t required.

Further, they have always believed in a hierarchal society, akin to how Europeans think, and were the ones who brought slavery to America. 

Republicans believe that every person should make his or her own life. We don't discriminate on the basis of race, we believe in a merit based society. We also believe that a person can rise above the particular socioeconomic position they were born in. Europeans believe this is fantasy. 

Americans have proved that philosophy wrong so many times. So to have other countries, like Singapore, those that have adopted free market style economies and merit based philosophies. 

The success of our common person so annoys Europeans that the French came up with a word for it, they derisively call it ""nouveau riche"" and imply that if you were not born wealthy then you are still low class. The amusing thing is that no one in America cares about class except perhaps those Democrats who long for the days of European aristocracy.

But for the Germanic people you guys would border poverty, you are already stuck in a malaise of mediocrity and have no where to go. You've taxed the rich as much as you can now you are fighting amongst yourselves.

I wasn't going to stand between siblings, but as my eldest was moved out and on his own and my youngest was still at home, protecting my youngest and allowing them to feel safe *and in control*  was 100% my priority.

Also, I was writing stream of thought. I didn't put everything in order. The wedding was first, the birthday second, the trans comment third. And the trans comment is indeed when my youngest went no  contact. It was also when my eldest disowned me. I asked him to please not disown his siblings or other family members, and he said he'd call them, but my youngest has never returned his calls and will probably never do so.

I will always be here if he ever reaches out. I will always love him. But so long as my youngest lives with me, he won't be allowed to come to our home. He can't come to holidays. He's raising two beautiful kids I see as my grandkids but have no contact with. And because we lived in Texas and my youngest wasn't safe there as a trans child, we have now moved across the country to a state that supports trans rights. The last thing I said to my son is that when one of those grandbabies grows up to be gay or trans or something else he hates, he can send them to grandma. He cussed me heavily and said that I shouldn't wish that on his kids, and that he was going to be a better parent than me so it wouldn't happen.",SquirrellyGrrly

In fact, he’s actively trying to go around it to keep himself out of jail and, as a former President, he should be the first person upholding the law. If he’s truly innocent, as he claims, then he shouldn’t be trying to delay these trials or trying to hide behind claims of presidential immunity. He should be standing up in court and confronting the charges head on. But he’s not. He’s simply shouting to the media about how everyone is treating him unfairly and begging his supporters to pay his legal bills for him.

Biden wasn’t my first choice in 2020. I want to be honest about that. But he is, in fact, the lesser of two evils in this case and, in my opinion, has done a decent job in spite of taking the job under some very trying circumstances. Yes, the country is still a long way from perfect, but there have been signs that things are improving. As to your earlier point about the foreign conflicts in Europe and Africa, Biden didn’t start those and, so far as I know, we haven’t sent troops to those conflicts, just arms and supplies. I have heard of Americans volunteering to help but that’s all I know.

I’m not saying that Biden is this country’s saving grace. Personally, I would rather we get some younger blood in the Oval Office, someone who can truly help lead us into the future. Still, I would much rather have Biden as president than Trump.

Long story about how at that ended up happening, but when I finally got him out of my home he spent the night outside smoking crack with his friend who promptly abandoned him when the money was gone. Then he tried to go to a homeless shelter but they were all full. So he decided to say he was suicidal at the emergency room so they would take him in. Our local hospital has a psych unit so they put him up there with a nice bed and three meals a day and they even hooked him up with physical therapy for his bad knee And I assume they were helping him with the alcohol withdrawals.

I was still speaking to him because he had left all his stuff at my place because he had nowhere to bring it, so he would call me from the hospital to ask me to drop off random things like clothing or books or whatever

So one day this man calls me and he is absolutely giddy. He’s talking really fast and he’s all excited and he’s telling me how the president is going to eliminate Obamacare and he’s thrilled

You guys I laughed so hard. I had to explain to this man that the only reason he has a bed to sleep in right now is because of Obamacare. He was unemployed but Abel bodied and he had Medicaid, our state never expanded Medicaid before Obamacare, the only reason he had Medicaid was because of the ACA

So I explained to him that if it goes away he will get kicked out of the hospital or he will end up with $50,000 bill on his credit report.

Then he tried to tell me that the ACA doesn’t work. I said what do you mean.

He proceeds to tell me that there’s a man in the psych unit with him from Massachusetts. The guy has Massachusetts Medicaid. We live in New Hampshire.  So the psych unit took him in, and got him stabilized, but they told him he was going to have to transfer to a Massachusetts facility because we don’t actually take Medicaid from another state that’s not how it works

So I said yeah that’s actually how it works that means it’s working

So this fool tells me “well he can’t go to a facility in Massachusetts because he has warrants in Massachusetts and if he goes there the police might come”

OK first of all that has nothing to do with the ACA. And second of all if the state knew he had warrants and connected that they would stop the Medicaid. In every state that I have lived in if you are a fugitive from justice you cannot get benefits from that state. I don’t think they talk to each other, so someone would have to tell them, but you can’t collect benefits from the state as a fugitive of justice",Ok-Hovercraft621

He was trying to come up with some convincing counterargument on the spot that was more about having to be right and looking superior, rather than critically provide an alternative perspective that may merit changing or modifying your opinion on the truth.  

Whats concerning is that he really tried to get you to buy his painfully flimsy bullshit. 

Sometimes I wonder if people like this guy actually aren’t all that unaware of how cutting all these foundational social programs will hurt them too, but they still zealously support cutting them so they can create their dream utopian society of cannibalistic wolves and grotesquely manipulative inhuman monsters.  A country where they can finally stop pretending to give a fuck about anyone but themselves.  

A country that would not be able to exist before quickly collapsing in on itself and crumbling in a hysteria of relentless self-interested destruction of one another until there was nothing left to exploit.  They just don’t get that there is nothing romantic or superior about what they ultimately want, and they aren’t clever or playing you like a fiddle with their obviously ill-thought-out attempts at manipulating you into supporting their ultimate end goals.  They are not “playing chess on plane above the one your on”, they are trying to play chess without knowing how each piece can move…they are literally lacking a dimension in cognitive capabilities which also happens to make them incapable of being aware of how lacking this dimension of understanding makes it painfully clear to normal functioning individuals that they can’t ever comprehend how they could be, and are, wrong.  And certainly how not being able to understand how they could be wrong, also therefore doesn’t mean they must clearly then be correct in their assumptions about how the world works.  How society works.

Basically, just because you cant see any way you could be wrong, by no means proves you must then be absolutely right.  The goddamn sun doesn’t orbit the earth just because you can’t understand how its demonstrably provable that its vice versa.  I’d feel pity if it weren’t for the fact that pity is exactly what they want you to feel for them so they can get their inroad into manipulating you.  

Some people just don’t have any ability to be self and socially aware.  Its nobody’s fault, nature’s a cruel and random mistress, and nobody has any obligation to totally forego their better judgement and let these kind of people wreck havoc on society just to make them feel better about themselves and accepted by their fellow humans.  Cause the kicker is, they never gave a fuck about those things to begin with.  Its a strange and chilling exultation of sociopathic values by the masses, designed to turn perfectly normal and rational people into cultists zealously convinced that aligning with these insane values will be what leads the country back to greatness and freedom from corruption.

He is under indictment for his alleged hush money payments to cover up his affair with Stormy Daniels, his attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia and his hoarding of classified documents at his property in Florida. All of these cases have solid evidence against him and have been proceeding in the most fair manner possible.

But there hasn’t been a single investigation launched into Biden and his family that has turned up a single shred of substantive evidence. I’m not saying that he’s not crooked but, assuming he is, nobody has been able to prove it.

Also, the video claims 130,000 people voted fraudulently. A quick google search shows that it has been fact checked in this USATODAY article (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/02/05/fact-check-viral-post-makes-false-claims-nevadas-election/4392902001/). The senator or representative in question in the video is reading off a Facebook post about the break down of “fraudulent” votes. I’d highly suggest taking a peek at other sources to those claims cuz every one I have looked can’t seem to prove it happened.

My previous point still stands, it’s impossible to have such a high number of fraud and not have it found out. The idea that the election was stolen has been the worst propaganda in this century. It has completely destroyed the faith in elections, especially where Trump is involved. Are you going to claim fraud again if Trump loses again? What about if he runs again in the next election and loses? What about Georgia? Why not talk about Trump wanting to commit fraud there to win? What about in Nevada? (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/show/nevada-charges-pro-trump-fake-electors-accused-of-attempting-to-overturn-2020-election)

The fact is, Trump is a bully. People don’t like him. A certain portion of America does and that’s their prerogative. But to throw a fit and say that fraud was why he lost is toxic to our democracy. All I’ll say is, don’t claim fraud if he loses again.",Siri1104

Second, inflation doesn't happen overnight.  The causes happen years before -- in the 70s, it was paying for Vietnam.  In this case, who cut taxes $2 trillion and was warned by economists that there'd be inflation down the road?  Who ran a deficit of $4 trillion AFTER that?  That  would be Trump, twice. Biden's was $2 trillion.  Inflation under Biden peaked at about 10%, and that inflation came from two places -- Trump and corporations (they ran record profits when inflation was soaring, because they raised their prices TO CAUSE INFLATION).  WalMart's profits increased 93%.  Inflation is now 3%.  If something goes from 10% to 3% it is FALLING.  Why do people have to work 2 or 3 jobs?  Simple: THEIR WAGES ARE TOO LOW.  Why is that the case?  Hell, the rich people have way too much money.  There's a bigger gap between the rich and the poor today than during the days of the robber barons.  Almost every cent of increased productivity from American workers since 1965 has gone to the top 0.1%.  Used to be that 2/3 of all income taxes were paid by corporations and 1/3 by individuals.

But no man. At least in California, mental facilities are awful. I’ve also heard of Washington facilities as well doing the same thing. People seriously simply do not know what goes on in mental facilities, for the majority of people do not use them. For those that actually try and use them, they are generally not legitimate places of health. If out of 9 facilities of heard of between me and other people personally, only 1 even attempted to help let alone did help instead of directly damage the psyche of the patient, shouldn’t that say something about the ratio of good to bad?

I am not saying that all facilities are evil or anything, but if only 1 in 9 doesn’t actively harm you then what is even the point of going to them when in crisis? It’s rolling dice. It’s to the point where no matter what you do, follow their advice, do whatever they tell you to the letter, take all their medicine that makes you worse, only for them to extend their legal hold on you and take your money against your will, all while you’re getting worse and worse to the point you don’t function when you get out… this is what you’ll most likely experience as a result of trying to go to one. Just like, why *shouldn’t* I paint broadly when I describe mental facilities? Especially facilities that mark you as “legal hold” and won’t let you out when you go in voluntarily which I’m pretty sure is illegal which is why I mentioned the extortion.

It’s like saying there are still good cops when people say ACAB. Yes there are, but the caveat there is the amount of bad cops makes it near impossible to find a good one in the wild. And even so I did say that I found one facility that helped me so I’m not saying absolutely all of them are awful, just most.

The US policy is NOT genocide -- but is about supporting allies, including Israel.  That by no means can be conflated to mean when Israel kills civilians in warring against Hamas, that Biden is happy and proud and wishes more of the same.

Do you suppose when the US kills civilians as collateral damage in drone strikes or when they were in Iraq, that Israel is thrilled about that?  Should our allies abandon us when that happens?

Should our allies have abandoned us in WW2 when German cities were fire-bombed?   Was the US committing ""genocide"" against Germany when bombing German cities?

Look, if Israel wanted to commit genocide, there are many more efficient and faster means to do so.  Source:  Operation Reinhard, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\_Reinhard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Reinhard)

""1.47 million or more Jews were murdered in just 100 days from late July to early November 1942 ...  In the time frame of July to October 1942, the overall death toll, including all killings of Jews and not just Operation Reinhard, amounted to two million killed in those four months alone.""  

So yeah, while killing civilians is horrible, bad, ugly and wrong, in any war or for any reason, using the ""G"" word isn't accurate here.  While 30,000 civilians have been killed (and that is bad and not cool at all), there are millions of people there.

Genocide would be if Israel was purposefully killing ALL in Gaza and everywhere else, millions of people, and going after them outside of areas where they are going after Hamas.  They aren't.  And if they wanted to, it would have happened already (see above source - it doesn't take long if that's what is wanted).   And they would also be rounding up people in all lands they control, such as Israel itself, to commit that genocide.

So yes, complain about Israel all you want in its overreaction to Hamas.  But let's not try to knock Biden during an important election against Trump -- okay?  We don't need your supposed insight into ""Biden's role"" -- like its some new US foreign policy to support Israel or something.",HHoaks

And calling it “evil” isn‘t helpful rhetoric.  Was Obama evil, was Trump evil when they droned places and civilians were killed?  Should all our allies abandon the US for Japan, Vietnam, Iraq and other “evil” By the US?

Clearly the US is looking at revamping how it works with its ally here, but that doesn’t happen overnight.  There are larger strategic interests at play above my and your pay grade, involving Iran, Syria and the entire region.  We don’t just jump ship on allies - that’s not how it works.",HHoaks

Anything else is just a translation, which can be tainted intentionally or unintentionally by one's biases or miseducation. 

There is another form of prayer called dua, which is a prayer of supplication, and it's generally accepted that you can make those prayers in any language you like, to ask Allah SWT for anything you need.

This ruling is stated by the primers of the Hanafi School, namely, works which transmit the positions of [primarily] the Imam, and his two main students. In the case of any unclarity regarding the positions of the Imams, these authoritative texts are what we rely upon.

Imam Abu Hanifa (Allah Most High be well-pleased with him) had a nuanced view of the Qur’an. He held that the Qur’an comprised of two perspectives: the perfectly, revealed words (nazam) and the meaning (ma`na). His original position was that it would be legally valid to recite the Qur’an in other than Arabic because this is also Qur’an from the perspective of its meaning. However, the sound and relied upon position is that he retracted this judgement, and concurred with the view of his students who said that prayer in non-Arabic is invalid except in the case of inability.

As for the point mentioned by Haskafi in al-Durr al-Mukhtar [and others before him], it is a sound application of the [original] principle of the Imam. Thus, the permission extends to reciting the Qur’an alone. If a person recited a verse from the Bible, Psalms or Torah, and such a verse directly corresponded to, and undeniably contained the meaning of, a verse in the Qur’an, this would be acceptable insofar as he is reciting the meaning of the Qur’an. This is conceivable given the original, revelatory nature of such books.

The upshot is that this is the nature of law (fiqh) and jurisconsults (fuqaha). They work with a given set of principles to extract rulings which will enable humankind to worship Allah Most High until the end of time. If things seem unclear or unreasonable, you should consult with living jurists who can clarify the matter for you. Everything else is misgivings and ill-opinion of some of the greatest of the Elect (awliya’) of Allah. And we seek refuge in Allah Most High from the devils of mankind and jinnkind alike. [Qur’an, 114]

2024-04-05 16:36:25,ky6yvka,"A few points:

1) Are you aware of the existence of Original Pronunciation (OP) performances of Shakespeare, that specifically aim to replicate (as accurately as possible) the 'accent' (or, more accurately, phonology) of the time? I believe there have been Original Pronunciation productions at The Globe. How do you think these might stack up, relative to a 'Standard American' accent? (And what, precisely, do you mean by a 'Standard American' accent here?)

2) Are we certain that the accent in question is a significant enough factor in the accessibility of these performances to warrant this kind of blanket statement? For instance, I would argue that a major factor in what makes a performance of a Shakespearean text compelling and comprehensible is the skill of the actor, and specifically their knowledge of Early Modern drama overall. The best performers of Shakespearean texts are typically very well-trained British actors and members of the RSC (Royal Shakespeare Company), who are exceptionally dedicated and knowledgeable, not just as ACTORS, but as SHAKESPEAREANS. I would wager that Simon Russell Beale's King Lear would be a far more accessible performance because of his intimate knowledge and understanding of the text, wordplay, and emotional resonance, than an equally skilled actor with less specific knowledge/experience who just happened to have an American accent but hadn't spent the bulk of their career studying, performing, and breathing Early Modern drama. Of course, you could probably get Simon Russell Beale to do a killer King Lear IN an American accent, but I'm not buying that that would add much in terms of clarity at that point. By the same token, I'm sure plenty of American actors are very capable RSC members – but again, is the ACCENT what is making the difference?",dreamofdandelions

To me, the Shakespeare that is the easiest to understand is when actors themselves are the one who understand the script inside and out and know what their dialogue means, both linguistically and in context of their character.

Point is they’ve both heavily diverged from Shakespearean English with vowel sounds going all over the place, so the rhotic is about the only thing that matches, but other sounds will throw off Shakespeare more than some things in the BBC accent.

I would actually argue that to my modern British ear, it sounds more like a meshing of Irish, Northern Irish, and West Country: ie, not straightforwardly British (Irish isn't British!), and definitely what most people think when they think a 'British' accent, but definitely not American! If we're going to get actors to perform in an accent other than their own, why not just go for OP? I understand that OP is somewhat contentious and that many Shakespearean scholars would rightly urge us to be very cautious about any strong claims to ""authenticity"", but if aiming for ""authenticity"" in the name of making the original wordplay audible is your goal, then surely it makes far more sense to go for our closest estimation of that phonology, rather than asking actors to adopt a different accent that arbitrarily sounds closer to the ""original"" in *some* respects, and not in others?

Edited to add, re. your second point: I wasn't suggesting that it is either/or. I was suggesting that I don't think it's as big a factor as the quality of the performance overall, and specifically the actor's ability to capture and convey humour/tone/subtext, which I don't think is really affected by the accent. Where puns are concerned, I can see that *some* might be better served by an 'American' accent than British RP, but since Shakespeare's work is littered with wordplay, and puns can involve all sorts of sounds, surely that would still miss plenty (and perhaps actually be worse at capturing others than British RP) – which brings me back to the question: why not OP?",dreamofdandelions

American English has a closer (not super close but closer) range of vowel sounds and a rhotic r that could aid in comprehension.

For example, the Kenneth Branagh version of Much Ado About Nothing vs the Joss Whedon version. The Branagh version was superior in so many ways. It was incredibly well-acted (I even liked Keanu Reeves), the sets were beautiful, and it was the kind of fun you expect. The Whedon version was quite obviously done on a tiny budget with his friends. 

Although I liked the Branagh version more overall (it’s definitely a classic), I found that I understood the jokes more or comprehended the Whedon version in another way that made it really resonate. I don’t experience this same thing when I watch contemporary British shows, or period pieces like Pride and Prejudice so it’s not like I need something in my own accent, quite the contrary.

Going to your specific example of the Whedon version of Much Ado About Nothing, the thing I really enjoyed about it that you might have picked up on was not the accents specifically so much as it updated to be modern in everything *but* the words.

Just look at the double standards. Israel needs to provide free electricity and water to Gaza which literally attacked them. Literally nobody in world history ever demanded that a defending nation needs to provide for basic necessities for free ( or paid ) to their invader. Nobody demands Ukraine should continue paying the electricity bill for occupied territory. 

**One example you didn\`t mention**, **which is not about ""big country does what it wants"", would be Azerbaijan.** A country that just a few weeks before October 7th invaded Armenia and \~150.000 people fled or were expelt from a region where Armenians lived for 2500 years. Extreme imperialism and settler colonialism, indisputable and nobody gave a shit. The Armenian-Azerbaijan war was only briefly touched by Western media in the context of Russia, because both are CSTO members ( i.e. ""Russian-NATO"" ) and it made Russia look bad, especially because they promised support to Armenia but didn\`t. 

Azerbaijan is a hardcore extremist country. Dictator rules since 2003. In 2004 Ramil Safarov, an Azerbaijani, went to Hungary for a NATO training exercise where he met 2 Armenians, he killed one in his sleep with an axe while he failed to kill another. He got 30 years in Hungarian prison,, during interrogation he mentioned how he only regretted not having killed more Armenians, his defence attorney literally claimed that his client didn\`t know any better because ""it\`s not a crime to kill Armenians in Azerbaijan"". He spent 8 years in prison before being extradited in a corrupt deal ( due to Viktor Orban ) to Azerbaijan, where he was immediatly pardonded by the Azerbaijani president and the country, the entire Azerbaijani population, celebrated him as a national hero. He was promoted, got 8 years worth of salary and a free apartment. People from all social classes praised him, including the most famous Azerbaijani singer who claimed this is what any good Azerbaijani should do and that she would have done the same.   
Not even Nazi Germany celebrated people for murdering jews, there was no employee of the month in extermination camps, Hitler didn\`t congratulate a random soldier for murderng a jew, the Nazis tried to hide their atrocities. Today\`s Azerbaijans extremist attitude towards Armenians is worse than Nazi Germany\`s attitude towards jews, this is an undisputable fact.

And that country just a few weeks before the Hamas invasion, invaded Armenia and the conflict ended in late November, i.e. 1.5 months after Hamas invasion, yet naturally nobody gave a shit. 

There are videos of how Armenian POWs and civilians are treated by unmasked! Azerbaijanis who openly torture and humiliate them. They don´t fear being held accountable because neither the Azerbaijani government, nor any international organization is going to do anything about it, so the depraved torturers literally have no problem being public with it.

Turkey attitude towards the Armenian genocide is ""it didn\`t happen, but they deserved it"", Azerbaijan\`s attitude is ""it didn\`t happen, but we will do it again"", they were naturally involved in the Armenian genocide and they are extremely racist and hostile towards anything Armenian.  
Turkey and Azerbaijan are also openly discussing creating a corridor through Armenia in order to connect their countries... And only Iran and a few countries in Europe are opposing that.

Or just look in general what happend to the Middle Eastern christians. The Middle East used to be 19% christian in the year 1900, it\`s 2% by 2023. Assyrians went from 1.5 million ( 4.6% of Iraq ) to 100.000 - 150.000 ( 0.2% of Iraq ) and northern Iraq was the homeland of the Assyrians. Now Assyrians only live in exile or eastern Syria. Lebanon was 90% christian in 1900, 55% in 2000, 52% in 2011 and its down to 30% in 2023. A majority christian country and now it\`s only a significant minority. There are about 5 million lebanese people in Lebanon, but 12-18 million Lebanese people in the world and about 85% of Lebanese people are christian, but not in their own country.

now i see more and more of it that i was either blind to before or is just exponentially increasing antisemitism. like just recently when some millionaires tried to make a deal to take land from the armenian quarter in jerusalem recently. the group on the other side of the deal called it off but bulldozers came anyway with cops and a bunch of people probably hired by the millionaires to harass the small armenian population. people instantly spun this to ""LOOK AT THESE RACISTS ISRAELIS!!!!

Was not made in a vacuum but happened after a coup attempt, off which the suspected organizer was not being extradited this combined with the USA arming what looked to them as a branch of the pkk caused Turkey to not wanting to solely rely on the USA for their air defence.( this was probably a mistake)  -Turkey has used refugees to treated the EU only in so far as saying that they don’t have the means to stop them and won’t inforce there side of the border  - the Cyprus occupation happens after radical Greeks killed the president, couped the government and started killing Turkish villagers. After peace talks failed Turkey annexed a part of Cyprus ( It has ironically become like the West Bank where it would be hard to give back the annexed area)

No problem!

Let's say they are (even tho I don't recall pkk plane highjakings, that could also be a media blindspot on my side) comparing how the IDF acts in Gaza vs how the Turcish army acts in norther Syria is crazy. 

>-there are disagreements about where the maritime borders are caused by possible large gas reserves in the Mediterranean 

I remember them them lowkey declaring war on France:  
Two Turkish frigates accelerated to protect the cargo and prevented the French from carrying out the inspection. The freighter, supposed to deliver medicine to Tunisia, docked in the Libyan port of Misrata to deliver M-60 tanks, Hawk missiles and mercenaries.  
A few days later, it was the turn of Courbet, another French ship, this time under NATO command, to try to approach Cirkin. But one of the Turkish frigates who came once more to the rescue of the freighter, activated its fire control radar against the French vessel. In naval jargon, this is called ""illumination."" **Radar illumination is considered an act of war, because it is the last action before opening of fire.**  
This incident, which could have led to war, reflects the degraded state of relations between countries that are supposed to be allies.

2024-04-05 17:57:40,ky7dlo7,"Nah I 100% agree with you there. It is very, very painful. 

It\`s especially disgusting, an atrocious irony, because Armenians were basically the jews of the Ottoman Empire. Islam was a bit more restrictive with professions as they saw only religious scholars, soldiers and farmers as virtuous jobs, while everything else, especially finance, was delegated to the minorities. In the Ottoman Empire, this were Christians, in the eastern half primarily Armenians. 

In 1913 16/18 highest banking positions in the Ottoman Empire were filled with Armenians, Armenians were responsible for 40% of the economy and held roughly 1/3rd of the entire industrial sector of fledling industrializing nation. When the population got a bit mad, pogroms were made against Armenians which were supported by the Elite, similar to jews in Europe. Despite being the strong rich middle class, they had no benefits as their positions could be taken away at ease, they were blamed for everything and the masses hated them. Just like with jews, they were subject to a genocide where millions died. 

Armenians and Jews are very much alike, their history is almost identical, their treatment, especially by their neighbors, is very much identical and in another comment, back in October, I mentioned how it is kinda disgusting how Israel not only NOT helps Armenia, but supports Azerbaijan with weapons trade.

Agree with some of this. 10-20 years is for people with no value to the US. If you are already a specialized labor, it’s much faster, OP became a specialized labor in the US and that’s literally the American dream, but what is the success rate for integration in this kind of background? I think the US has immigration right, people are just mad because their useless cousins can’t come in 6 months. OPs success is awesome, I had a similar experience, but it’s not demonstrative of a statistical relevant success. Yes I will always advocate for legal immigration and I don’t think our policies are unfair and illegal immigration is not great for any country.",samwoo2go

2024-04-06 02:58:53,ky9sbtc,"I’m a first generation Mexican American born to immigrant parents who arrived with $30 in their pocket. Stories I’ve heard range from sleeping outside to sharing a $0.99 burger between two people (3 if you count my unborn older sister in my mother womb). That was 1985 ish. Now they’re worth at least $1M after hitting it off successfully in a landscaping business. Their two kids, my sister and I, are also successful although we find it hard with economic crisis after economic crisis. First in 2009. Then 2020. 🤦🏻‍♂️ either way our parents always taught us to work hard. And we did. I’m an engineer for the feds (recently got that job at GS-13) and my sister is a nurse studying to be a Nurse Practioner. 

These types of stories were very common. Nowadays not so much. But I think the common stories of being unsuccessful probably outweigh those of being successful. It’s probably a slightly like the stock market nowadays. You have one guy going from $1,000 to $1,000,000 in a couple of months but the vast majority of day traders end up losing money.",stankpuss_69

Legally, 20 years for non skilled labors and 1 year for engineers. I don’t see why that’s bad or racist. Once you become an American, the concern should be more about what will advance all Americans rather than back home. America is our home now",samwoo2go
2024-04-06 03:33:29,ky9wu4q,"I do see your point,  but I think you got it backwards. In fact, I think legal immigration is what makes life more challenging by immigrants coming in from countries with skills that are needed, but they didn’t pay for it. For example, India. Free college. So when they come here, they can take smaller wages. Keeping wages down for citizens. Same goes for physicians. 

I think we should encourage our own people to pursue needed skills rather than bring in legal immigrants. 

The illegal immigrants will hardly displace any Americans from their jobs because lower middle class jobs are plentiful. Think of it from my perspective. If my employer wants to cut me because they pay me too much and bring in a sponsored engineer from India, what stops them? Sponsoring takes as little as 3 months. 

Now don’t get me wrong, we still need people with their skills to come here. We just need to worry about our own people first. Most Americans want higher paying jobs not the jobs the illegals will fill. It’s more likely a legal immigrant will displace an American than an illegal.

And then think of the implications to the country of origin. If we’re taking all their doctors… is it really ethical? 🤔 there’s so much to these issues. It’s not black and white and nothing we say here will change anything 😂",stankpuss_69

You said you're 21 now, so you'll be ~30 in 2033. The petition was pending for 15 years, so your CSPA age would be 15 and you'd be eligible to receive a green card along with your parent.

It's a little bit more complicated because the calculation involves the visa availability date rather than the I-130 approval date, but this is the general idea. 

And you should still be fine to receive a student visa.

There is no reasoning with anyone under a red hat.   Decent Republicans who oppose him are really secretly Democrats.   There is nothing that will ever change their minds.   They would sacrifice their newborn to elect their god.   And, incidentally, at a conservative PAC meeting last year they had a ""golden"" tRump on hand for worshippers to bow down to---quite reminiscent of the golden calf the Israelites built and worshipped when God didn't respond quickly and the way the wanted.

2024-04-05 17:55:30,ky7d7gs,"There was a really good interview on NPR with a historian who wrote a book on British counter intelligence during WW2. Early in the war the British tried using facts, figures, and logic to try and get Germans to leave the Nazi party. Of course it didn't work.

Then a new guy took over counter intelligence and he took a different approach. He believed that people turn to political strongmen because they feel they have no control over their own lives. They sacrifice their individuality to be a part of a group that claims to have simple answers to complex problems.

So to counter that his approach was to try to give people a sense of agency and to undermine their sense of community and restore their individuality. For instance the British agents spread a rumor that Nazi generals were having secret orgies. The key part of the story was they were using butter as lube. At the time Germans only got small rations of butter and it was almost impossible to get for soldiers on the front lines. Basically the british were trying to drive a wedge between the common man and the people higher up in the Nazi party to undermine their sense of community.

Another example was they dropped papers for wrapping cigarettes near the German front lines. Somehow they had printed instructions on how to safely surrender to allied troops. The instructions gave German soldiers different options on how to do it. Giving the soldiers options was the whole point. The goal was to give people back some sense of control.

Anyway the author then linked it to MAGA saying to get people out of that cult you have to give them agency over their own lives and restore their sense of individuality.",J-Frog3

2024-04-05 22:59:54,ky8tb9d,"Statistically, most people do not change their minds based on facts. Instead, they find out a way to undermine facts with ideas of subjective truth. This is where the backfire effect is seen. To change your mind based on facts, you have to be in love with truth. Most people assign their identity to their belief system and are in love with that. To change their beliefs is to lose part of their identity and social network.

To beat this, you have to use a backdoor approach. You can't debate face-to-face. You have to ask people what they believe and why. You have to ask questions like, ""What would it look like if this weren't the case?"" and ""What would it take you to believe something else?"". You also have to show them that they aren't bad people for believing anything and that they can keep a sense of self and community after changing their beliefs.

Or, you can slowly trickle propaganda into something that isn't quite related. That's how the right-wing recruits kids to their politics via Youtube.

The economy has done well but many of the jobs that are added are government jobs or people working multiple jobs. Finally, inflation has outpaced wages which could have been inevitable but MAGA wants a scapegoat to blame Biden.

2024-04-05 21:04:58,ky8anmj,"So, some of this is incorrect. And unfortunately due to the size of the post, it would take me ages to unwrap literally every false point or misleading point. So my main point is these 6.

1: while I think the bump stock ban was an overreach, the Biden admin has been astronomically more tyrannical when it comes to online censorship, 2A rights, and general expansion of government powers.

2: The biggest surge of migrants came when Trump announced the stay in Mexico policy, and dropped dramatically after that. Trump also being obstructed by the democrats every step of the way did not help get anything done. Russiagate, and all these hoaxes that he had to fight slowed him down. The border bill mentioned also snuck an enormous amount of money to Ukraine, which is why republicans voted against it. Spending for Ukraine and Israel is insanity right now and needs to be dialed back.

3: The energy crisis is pretty bad right now. We are not drilling more than ever, theres been a monumental decrease. Permits are getting revoked, non-renewed, or denied for drilling and fracking on federally owned land, and new drilling in the gulf has largely halted entirely. We've also shut down several major nuclear plants in the US instead of making more. Our continued overreliance on renewables is straining parts of the country like california that don't have many fossil fuel plants, who are now importing energy at an ever increasing rate. We're simply buying more oil from the saudi's and OPEC, who have artificially increased the price since the sanctions on Russia. Funny enough, Biden actually just yesterday I believe cancelled plans to refill the strategic oil reserve to keep prices low, the same ones he emptied to also, keep prices low. So whoever comes in next is gonna have a massive hike in gas prices because of that.

4: I dunno if you've gone out in the job market right now, seen what the actual inflation is, and yknow, bought stuff lately, but my monthly expenses have almost TRIPLED since 2019. Food, gas, EVERYTHING is more expensive. And while yes, my wages have gone up, they have not gone up enough to cover the massive increase in costs for daily living. The median home price in my city when from 150k to 275k for similar properties in similar areas due to not only price increases, but the influx of californians and new yorkers buying up property for 20-125% over asking.

5: I am SO tired of the woke agenda, the indoctrination of children, child sex changes, drag queen story hours, explicit sexual content that has no educational value in schools, and oh so very tired of being called a bigot, racist, nazi, fascist, whatever other name, for asking a fuckin question. It's exhausting, and if thats what the left is about, count me the fuck out.

6: Crime is out of control due to lax laws. I have seen more violent offenses, drug related crimes, and sexual crimes committed than ever. Violent crime has increased about 15% year over year since we've had a democrat mayor and it continues to get worse and worse. Our current mayor is certainly much better than the previous, but he can't fix any issues because of how bad the system was left for him.

2024-04-05 16:29:33,ky6xmqn,"MAGA: All politicians are corrupt, so I'm voting Trump because at least he can't be corrupted by the deep state.

Reality: Trump did everything the corpocracy that runs the Heritage Foundation (which has been in place since Nixon and is the true deep state) wanted him to do during his term as president. That is cut taxes for the rich, deregulate corporations and put corrupt judges in place that are there solely to protect the rich. Trump retroactively cut his own taxes going back several years for those in the real estate business like himself.

MAGA: Biden is a racist and a pedophile that also raped someone.

Reality: Trump lost a lawsuit where the jury found he did in fact rape the defendant, has had two lawsuits filed against him for raping a 13 year old with Epstein, the courts also found he committed fraud, and he has been indicted for paying off a porn star during his run for president, indicted for stealing state secrets, and indicted for his actions during the insurrection that included fake electors in multiple states and defendants that have plea bargains. Biden has no lawsuits against him, was never on the Epstein flight list, and the Republicans House investigation has recently collapsed due to it being a fraudulent investigation.

MAGA: The economy and crime was better under Trump.

Reality: Trump's economy was collapsing when he ended his term with unemployment twice as high as Biden's with thousands of manufacturing jobs lost and skyrocketing murder and crime rate. Biden has had record low unemployment his entire term with a record number of manufacturing jobs brought back to the US and a significant reduction in crime.",Desperate_Wafer_8566

You also don’t get the full context when you only consume one side. Your explanation for why the border bill was rejected by Republicans is a perfect example. The GOP told Democrats they would not fund Ukraine unless the border was included. They negotiated what was the strongest set of measures ever, but then scuttled it because Trump told them to. The Democrats essentially gave them what they asked for and they still rejected it. Even the Republican negotiating the deal mouthed, “That’s true,” when Biden addressed it in the State of the Union.",goavibe

2024-04-06 00:22:41,ky95tun,"Someone can still make some good points, even have some facts, in a post that's overall BS. It would take much too much effort for me to run through the post and write exactly how each and every wrong point is wrong, which is why I pick a couple of examples.

Example 1:

> Our national debt increased $8.4 trillion under Trump, a record one-term accumulation. The deficit also exploded under Trump to a record $3.1 trillion.

While the poster on one hand excused everything bad under Biden with ""muh Covid,"" they then turned around and blamed Trump for spending that occurred as a result of Covid.

Example 2:

> That is true, but **inflation is now near normal levels** and wage growth has been outpacing inflation for 11 months which is leading to people having more purchasing power again.

Where you have shown you understood the difference between inflation rate and inflation, the OP has shown he's not as smart as you. The rate of inflation over the past year is still above what is commonly thought of as the ideal rate (3.2% vs 2%), so those price increases that you and OP on one hand dismiss, but then on the other call corporate greed, are affected by the increase in inflation. I'm also unsure where OP gets the idea that real wage growth has been so massive and astounding so as to wash out the increase in inflation. Over the course of a year from February 2023 to February 2024, real hourly earnings only increased 1.1%, however, the average workweek decreased by 0.6%, resulting in only a combined increase of 0.5% in real average weekly earnings.

https://www.bls.gov/news.release/realer.nr0.htm

So, sure, real wages have slightly gone up, but an extra few dollars isn't going to make people magically feel better about buying the >$10 Big Mac meal when just a few years ago it was more like $8. Much more important is the rising costs of what used to be the poor man's menu (aka the dollar menu), where even the basic cheeseburgers are around $3 now, when they used to be just over a dollar. McDonald's used to sell large sodas at $1, but now sell them at about $2. https://www.pennlive.com/life/2024/04/price-of-one-mcdonalds-menu-staple-increases-55-in-three-years.html

Are these huge costs? No, but they are still large percentage based increases and over the course of a year, people are now spending >50% more on just food.

Example 3:

> MAGA: Who cares. Gas was cheaper before Trump left office.

> Informed voter: You mean it was cheaper in 2020, when a global pandemic occurred and many people weren’t driving on the road, gas companies were desperate for revenue and the cost of a barrel of oil even dipped below $0 at times?

OP pretends the everyone is so stupid they couldn't look at a chart of [gas prices](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=m), nor that they have a memory better than that of a goldfish. Gas prices were cheaper before covid, they were cheaper during covid, and they still cheaper after covid too. The highest price of gas under Trump was in May 2018 at $2.987, a level that wouldn't be reached under Biden until May 2021 when it was recorded at $3.076. So, Trump's highest price point was lower than Biden's average gas prices since May 2021, which the OP also admits when he contradicts his own point in the next ""argument"" when he blames the rapid price increase to simply being from the Russia-Ukraine War.

> Informed voter: Gas prices went up largely due to most of the globe cutting off Russian oil imports in response to Putin’s war in Ukraine. Do you want to empower Russia with 10’s of billions of dollars while they’re invading a sovereign country? There’s no evidence that the keystone pipeline would have reduced gas prices. It would have unfortunately invited the risk of environmental disaster.

So, now prices are simply just from a reopened economy, now it's ""largely"" because of a war? How convenient for OP that he can speak out of both sides of his mouth while he makes poor excuses for Biden. Let's examine this one to it's full extent. When did the war occur? After the embarrassing disaster of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, of course!

Now, you may be asking yourself, how is the withdrawal relevant? Well, at a time where America is on the retreat around the world, where our intelligence seems lacking, and our president looks like a dope; Russia, with a loose alliance with China, and creating an opposing economic bloc with BRICS, thought that could take Ukraine. Now, what was Biden's response to Russia's build up of military forces? Biden went on national television and declared that any Americans in Ukraine better leave because the US would NOT save them no matter what and that if Russia did an invasion, NATO would simply squabble over sanctions. I remember being flabbergasted when I watched him speak those words, it was literally a green light to Russia. And what do you know? Russia shortly after invaded.

Now, you could argue that it doesn't really matter and Russia was going to invade anyway. That's fine, you don't have to agree with me, but this all leads into my next point, that being about gas prices. OP is arguing that gas prices are largely being influenced by the war in Russia, which is a hilariously stupid lie. Russia is a huge producer of oil, but they are not the only one and America itself has the largest reserves in the world, yet we mainly retain them for strategic purposes.

Now, because I have a memory, I can speak from my memory, unlike OP. Biden, like other Democrats, campaigned on reducing and eventually totally stopping fossil fuels ""for the climate!"" Which sounds great until they get into office and cause havoc with stupid policies. Which is exactly what happened. Biden curtailed domestic permits for drilling, his rhetoric on the campaign trail caused a price increase once elected, his rhetoric on Saudi Arabia caused the Saudis to not increase oil production when Biden came crawling to them. Biden alarmingly then used strategic oil reserves to drop prices strategically in the run up to the 2022 Midterm elections.

Maybe you'd argue that prices came down because BiDeN SuPeR SmArT or something, which Democrats already tried in 2021 when they had been denying the President had any responsibility for gas prices and then contradicted themselves when they announced Biden should be praised for going to China after being rebuked by the Saudis and sending them oil to reduce the price increases. Yet, still, prices have increased and remained up.

Which is now where we'll get into how prices are affected by world events. OP quite idiotically makes declarations about the price still being above where it should be because of the war and ""oh, you don't want to support those dirty dirty Russians, now do you?"" rhetoric that the Democrats have masterfully crafted for idiots to regurgitate without thought. While Russian oil has already been siphoned to other countries anyway,  THE WEST IS STILL RECEIVING RUSSIAN OIL!!!! India (aka one of the BR**I**CS nations) has been refining Russian oil and sending it to the West. News articles just in February broke what Western governments, and anyone with a brain, already knew to the common moron.

Russia has more money nowadays than they did before the start of the war. Less-than-moral companies have worked to cover up dumping Russian oil onto the Western market, India has been sending us Russian oil, the Russians have been supplying non-Western aligned nations oil (reducing international demand for oil, lessening the pressure on other oil producers to meet that demand). So, this completely idiotic argument that oil is still up because of the Russian war or something, is just that, fictitious garbage for the know-nothing masses to regurgitate and feel better about gas prices since now they feel like they're ""helping beat Russia.""

As you should be able to see by this point, it takes a lot to fully refute OP's stupid commentary. So, again, I'm not going to go point by point through OP's ridiculous post to point out each and every part where he's wrong and correct him.",kindad

Western society trains this behavior out of people because chewing with your mouth open is considered rude.

I mentioned here with the freelancing (graphic design) my that my country doesn't allow it because
Online businesses are online services do not exist. Self-employment IDs and tax numbers go handed hand only with physical businesses otherwise they won't consider it or as they say it won't be able to process it as it is too advanced. 


On the Upwork website for instance, they have tax information for countries like Nigeria and South Africa. And on that list as far as Africa goes my country is not on that there. That's why I had to inquire with tax professionals and lawyers to make sure I was doing things the right way and none of them could help me, they've never heard of it before. 


So I don't know what to do with that situation and no people get projects through Facebook receive money through money transfer companies or PayPal or whatever but getting clients has been a nightmare almost impossible.

Russia is an oligarchical, autocratic, mafioso state and has been that way since even before Putin. To compare the US to that is an insult to intelligent people in both countries. The US didn't ""modernize"" by selling off state businesses for pennies to thugs, they did it by creating a system where Microsoft and Apple could compete and thrive with some ground rules enforced by agencies empowered by the state.

If the US stock market fails, if the dollar becomes worthless, we will be in a failed society. Not a failed state, *society*. Lots of countries track the dollar for their currency. Lots of countries depend on the United States for security. Lots of countries depend on the US for trade (including China).

I'm a long time law obedient US citizen. Two years ago I've wired some of my hard earned money to help my elderly mother in Russia.  My transfer was arrested by feds with no explanation and no path for us to get our money back or dispute. After some time we found out that her Russian bank got sanctioned but we didn't know that at the time of transfer, and our US bank, which started the wire  didn't know that and didn't warn us and can't help us. You'd think they should just send our money back to us, with explaination, but nope - our money's gone like that.

My understanding is that OP lived in Russia but had assets in US or European accounts, which were frozen because the West wanted to punish Putin for starting the war. OP, who has probably done nothing wrong, had her savings taken by US government without a trial. It is understandable why OP is hesitant to invest in US.

OP, stock investment has many risks, including regulatory risk, and your concerns are valid. However, your risks of investing in US assets from within US are lower, since there are millions of people and lаw makers themselves doing same thing.

Everyone here telling you to get a lawyer is right but the truth is, that his options like any other immigrant are limited AF. 

If we are a bit more pragmatic here... There are three options here:

1. You divorce him and he stays illegal in the country he could be deported any day any year any moment, you just dont know when the hammer will hit. Collecting child support is gonna be hard but not impossible, assuming he is willing to cover the kid that is. This right here is your 50% of whats going to happen.
2. You divorce him and he gets deported or leaves the country. Thats the end of it. Forget about any child support whatsoever and the 10 year ban is just for starters, who know is at year 11 he will be given a visa, just look at all the other posts here about people getting denied. Having been in the states illegally usually works againts you. Assume he does not come back ever. 25% change of this happening.
3. You divorce after the greencard. Probably the best bet for your kid. Yall go your separate ways and he gets a normal job that pays taxes and child support, he remains a part of your kids life. 25% chance of this happening.

Where are the % coming from? Just from the odds of whats most likely the path that will move forward. A lot of people here are telling you about asylum claims and other paths but 99% chance they wont apply to him and none of them are a good way forward to keep a easy situation for your kid. This does not mean you have to stay with him.. Not at all. But do know the ramifications of it. Any chance of him getting another path to legalization are almost nil.

""A tenant must keep their rental unit clean, up to the standard that most people would consider ordinary or normal cleanliness."" If it's just disorganised due to obvious moving efforts, and there's still a walkable path/they can see most of the apartment, you're fine.

It's illegal to withhold your deposit (EDIT: As in, your last month's rent), you do not need to pay for cleaners, and it's not your responsibility that they get a renter for next month.",quiinzel
2024-04-04 19:54:24,ky2adbl,"Some basic facts you should know.

1 - Any deposit other than for last months rent or a key replacement, is illegal. If you don't get back all deposits after returning keys, you can file a T1 application with the LTB to force it's return (along with T1 filing fee). It's highly illegal for a landlord to withhold any deposit, even if they had a viable claim you damaged the place.

2 - Any request for entry that doesn't come with 24 hours notice, is not valid and you can refuse entry. Only exception is if they are entering to show unit to a prospective tenant, then only ""reasonable"" notice is required. So for an entry to check cleanliness, it's definitely 24 hours. If they enter illegally you can file a T2 (in parallel to a T1) to request some minor rent abatement (maybe $100 or so). Though for a single entry I would only consider this if you happen to be filing a T1 anyways. On it's own it's probably not worth it.

3 - They can't take pictures of your unit that would be used for advertising purposes, if they contain your belongings. They need your consent for this first.

4 - You don't need to overly clean, de-clutter etc for purposes of showing. If you are moving it is reasonable to assume there will be boxes and stuff lying around, and that is fine. As long as the place is not so cluttered that someone can't walk through all rooms in the place.

5 - Upon moving out you only need to leave place in ""broom swept"" condition. Any deep cleaning, painting, etc is the requirement of landlord to do and pay for after you leave, in preparation for next tenant. Any attempts by them to charge you for cleaning you can ignore or tell them to take it through the LTB to force you to pay (where they would most likely lose). Make sure you document yourself the condition of all areas and appliances upon vacating.",R-Can444

2024-04-05 01:26:13,ky3ugam,"This is appalling behavior by the real estate agent. Read over the Ontario Residential Tenancy Agreement. It's available online and is the only legal rental agreement in Ontario.

This agent can't just show up whenever she wants with an unauthorized person  (her mother) and harass you. She has to give 24 hrs notice. She can only come for valid reasons such as a showing, to take measurements, or to take pictures for the listing (not to show the labdlord your mess). She can't just show up to see how your packing is going or to tell you to clean more. 

She can phone, email, or text you to ask when you'll be moved out. No visit necessary. She can remind you to leave the apartment in a clean broomswept condition (no deep clean necessary), but she can't keep harping on this.

It's standard for landlords to bring in a cleaning crew after their tenants leave to do a deeper clean. Most landlords repaint at this time. The painting crew takes care of filling in small holes in the walls.

If the agent wants to bring people through to view the unit, you are under no obligation to do anything other than let them in if they give 24 hrs notice. Many tenants leave a mess for showings. That's why agents prefer a vacant apartment.

Ask this agent if her mother is a licensed real estate agent who is sharing the listing with her. If her mother isn't, then she has no right to enter the apartment.

Start documenting all the times this agent and her mother have entered the apartment (dates and times). Note what was said to you as well. Tell the agent you will make a complaint to RECO (Real Estate Council of Ontario) if she keeps violating your rights and bringing unauthorized people with her.

Tell your landlord that his agent is violating your tenant rights, and if it continues, you will complain to the landlord tenant board.

I speak English (fluent) and French (intermediate, but shit verlan) so will primarily look into (work-based) visas/immigration to countries that speak one of the two, but I just wanted to get some experience/advice. Im mainly anxious about timeline, moving expenses, and salaries. The move will have to be around Feb/March 2025. 

I’ll be doing my Australian visa 189 filing on my 25th birthday this summer, but I’d prefer Europe to be honest. Im really hoping for somewhere with a good enough salary to be able to live comfortably and save maybe 10% per year, have a good quality of life without it costing an arm and leg, strong social culture for young folks, and strong chances of long term immigration. For work I’ll be looking into manufacturing, biomedical, and possibly automative engineering positions.

2024-04-04 14:55:17,ky0r8s2,"Definitely not opposed! Do you know if the immigration stuff is similar to GB, or?",AslanJo
2024-04-04 14:02:48,ky0if4l,"I understand, I actually would not worry about the grade stuff too much. You don't need to go to a top school to make this happen, you could show up to a university in the north pole in Norway or Finland with average grades but a well thought out personal essay and good interview and you might gain admission and there's pretty good scholarships. For Germany and France it is also possible but you might need to dig a bit more, those countries have less english programmes for biomedical master's.

You have some work experience which is a positive so I think you should try to apply to jobs, but don't count on it. There are people with 10+ years of experience applying to those same visa sponsor jobs wanting a change in their life as well.

Education is one of those things that opens a lot of doors. If you actually want to move with a good timeframe to Europe you absolutely can with the right kind of mindset and effort. You won't end up in Ku Leuven or Oxford or anything but you can absolutely get a local diploma from somewhere (either a new bachelor's or doing a master's degree or an applied science degree to compliment your university degree) and that local diploma and years learning the job market will help you quite a bit in staying and getting permanent residence.

So,

1. start applying for jobs and see what happens, you never know
2. since your field is niche, a master's will help. A lot of things a biomed does (prosthetics etc) can be done equally as well by a general mechanical or electrical engineer so you have extra competition, master's allows you to specialize further into something even more, or you can apply for a master's in an adjacent field, like if your specialization in biomed was electrical components, you might qualify for a master's in electrical engineering which is very very helpful since it is a general major that is more in demand.

I see a lot of immigrants who hop between countries for marginal, debatable, temporary improvements. And I don’t think this is very practical. 

I don’t recommend moving to USA for few years. USA can be good if you figure out as much as possible about the country so you can pick the best location: housing vise, job vise, taxes, investment opportunities vise and numerous others things AND if you lived in USA long enough to benefit from all those years of growth ( USA can be very good country for this).

2024-04-05 01:01:03,ky3qoi5,"Interesting. I’m an Australian also working as a developer in Sydney. I can’t answer your question.

But I get the impression that your problem is really one of fulfilment and meaning.

Once you’re in a western country, you’ve already made it - there’s no other country that you could move to and reach total satisfaction across all dimensions: some things will become better and some things will become worse depending on where you go.

Here were your original points: remoteness, career progression, social relationships, and realestate.

Realestate affordability is going to be a calamity in any developed country, so I would honestly discard this criteria unless you’re 100% focused on looking to buy a property and settle down for the long term.

Career progression - how much further can you go, and how much further do you expect or will to go? If magically you now had a job working at say Google as a principal software engineer, how much better would your life really be than right now? Also, yes salaries in Australia for developers are “high” but I find that the cost of living eats away at the difference very quickly, and that problem becomes even worse when you go to other western countries where you lose ~30% in exchange rate against the euro and US dollar, or even 50% against the British pound… 

That leaves your remaining two criteria, which take me back to the idea of meaning and fulfilment. If it were me, I would make my decision based on this. Perhaps going back home to France is the best option here? You’ll have family, friends, your language, and your culture, and you should have more favourable state and social support as a citizen.

Anyway, sorry I can’t answer your question but those are just some thoughts I had reading your post.",ccaalluumm9
2024-04-04 14:46:09,ky0pmyc,"Hi, I’m a software engineer too. Why don’t you find something remote for your next role? Like a remote first company. That could solve the career concern. 

When it comes to social relationships, I think it’s like that in a lot of destinations nowadays. Put yourself out there and talk to strangers more. I’ve also made great friends and had great relationships from dating apps so I wouldn’t cross it out completely.

Also, what another user said here- you need to figure out the country the best you can in order to make the right choice because the US is having a huge shift moment right now and things are quickly changing.  I know quite a few people who are moving away . And yes, immigration is hard here and life is expensive. Health care is notoriously bad.  Have you ever considered other parts of Europe?

University programs/ work visas etc.

In my opinion I would recommend staying in Australia if you are comfortable there. 

It’s a solid country regardless!

You obviously don’t need to stay in Sydney forever! Maybe move to smaller town or surrounding suburbs! 


I would not recommend moving to the Nordics at all.

Scandinavians are notoriously insular and difficult to make friends with. Never mind living or integrating there.

Even my Norway friends from smaller towns find it hard to make friends when they move to the capitals.

2024-04-05 03:01:10,ky489vs,"Thanks for your answer. I guess there are two separate questions in my original post:

The first one is ""what tf do I want to do with my life?""

The second one is ""Where in the world would I maximize the chances of getting the life I want?""

Depending on what the answer to the former is, the latter will be different.

*""There’s no other country that you could move to and reach total satisfaction across all dimensions: some things will become better and some things will become worse depending on where you go.""*

Completely agree on this. I just want to understand the pros and cons of each country and adjust my choice accordingly.

*""Realestate affordability is going to be a calamity in any developed country, so I would honestly discard this criterion unless you’re 100% focused on looking to buy a property and settle down for the long term.""*

I partially agree with that, yes, it's getting worse everywhere, but that doesn't mean that it's the exact same situation everywhere.

*""yes salaries in Australia for developers are “high” but I find that the cost of living eats away at the difference very quickly, and that problem becomes even worse when you go to other western countries where you lose \~30% in exchange rate against the euro and US dollar, or even 50% against the British pound…""*

Australian salaries are higher in terms of savings for a single person.

Let's take a very simplified example: A SWE in Sydney with 3 years of experience will make around AU$120k, and \~€50k in Paris. The rent and other expenses values are based on my personal experience:

Sydney : savings = AU$120k (gross salary) - AU$31k (taxes) - AU$24k (rent) - AU$30k (other expenses) = **AU$35k/year**

Paris : savings = €50k - €16k (taxes) - €12k (rent) - €15k (other expenses) = €7k = **\~AU$12k/year**

I can confidently say that I save way more money in AU than I used to in France, all factors included. I agree that when you get married and have kids, the calculation may end up with a very different result, but for me there's a clear gap.

*""Career progression - how much further can you go, and how much further do you expect or will to go? If magically you now had a job working at say Google as a principal software engineer, how much better would your life really be than right now?""*

This. I can't answer this question, and tbh I don't think this can be answered without experiencing it. I don't have the required skill level for such a role, though.

*That leaves your remaining two criteria, which take me back to the idea of meaning and fulfilment. If it were me, I would make my decision based on this. Perhaps going back home to France is the best option here? You’ll have family, friends, your language, and your culture, and you should have more favourable state and social support as a citizen.*

I really don't want to go back to Western Europe. I'd rather stay in Australia. There are very few Aussies living in Western Europe, while there are plenty of Europeans in AU. I don't think that's a coincidence. The points I mentioned above are what I personally dislike about Australia, but I also have a long list of things I love here.

The internet. The internet has made a cartoon of almost all human relationships, and seriously devolved the way humans relate to one another.

2024-04-04 17:34:27,ky1k35b,"A lot of people commenting are not seeing the forest through the trees. What OP is trying to say is that the decade of the 90s was an upward trend. In general things were better than the decades before. Then the 2000s onward are a downward trend. Things got worse. 

Also, OP is probably speaking from a US perspective. To say that they are ignorant of the rest of the world might be true, but you can’t take every area of the world’s experience into account. Otherwise there is always a counter argument for any statement. Things are getting better. You are wrong, look at North Korea! Things are getting worse. You are wrong, look at Sweden (I’m saying Sweden out of ignorance. They just seem to do well.)

You had a middle class that grew in the 90s. The economy was better than the economy of the 80s. The middle class is now shrinking. 

People were very confident in the American dream because America just won a decades long Cold War which removed the threat of our greatest enemy at the time. It was a communism vs. capitalism war and we SEEMED to have won it. They also saw opportunities for economic growth which is a huge piece of the American dream. Now people don’t think that participating in the American economy will make them a better life. 

Racial and LGBTQ discrimination was being actively fought against and improved across the country. Solved? Hell no. However, the public conversation was directed towards tolerance and actively shaming bigotry in main stream media. It was more shameful to be a bigot. Now we have a rising racist/homophobic subculture that has felt empowered enough to be vocal with their hate. 

Technology was growing significantly. People were very excited about the growth and capability of computers. 

We found out that chlorofluorocarbons created a hole in the Ozone layer. As a world, we banded together to ban the use of chlorofluorocarbons to reverse this process. Now people actively deny climate change because they don’t want to sacrifice to solve it. 

We had a war in the gulf, yes that’s not good, but we also “won” the war within a few months. Which demonstrated American military superiority. Did we treat our soldiers and veterans from that war horribly? Oh hell yeah, but what’s new. That wasn’t a hallmark of the gulf war. That has been every war. Look at the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. We have lost more veterans to suicide than we have lost in combat and they get no support. 

That’s not to say that bad things didn’t happen in the 90s. People in the comments are saying “well, my mom was hit by a car in the 90s so actually they were very bad.” Or “my dad actually didn’t like his job and drank too much. That means things weren’t good.” OP isn’t saying that the world was perfect and that there weren’t concerns. If you think the world should, or could, be perfect you have watched too many Disney movies. 

In the 2000s, we had a domestic terror attack that scared the shit out of everyone and caused changes throughout the country. Flying changed dramatically. It is more stressful and costs more because of the extra security. Events across the US have increased security due to fears of terrorist attacks. It increased fear across the board significantly that has not gone away in 23 years. Only a few thousand people died in that attack, but it was the most successful thing they could have ever done and has cost so much more in lives, money, and mental health. 

We started 2 wars that lasted 20 years. This traumatized our soldiers and created a huge deficit from the somewhat balanced budget the 90s had given us. We also destroyed the countries and killed tens of thousands (probably more, but we don’t like to count) of innocent civilians indiscriminately in both countries. 

The boom in technology has changed from hopes of a better future to cell phone and video game addiction and fears of what it is doing to people including radicalizing large swathes of the populace. People have become even less social and participate in non-work social activities even less. 

The middle class is shrinking. The super rich have become hyper rich through a series of tax changes and are drawing more money into the top 0.1%. 

Someone said “well columbine happened in the 90s”. Yeah. That sucked and scared the shit out of people. What’s happened since? Instead of shootings every once in awhile they have become almost weekly to the point where the smaller ones aren’t even news anymore. 

AIDS was huge and scared people. COVID literally locked down much of the world. People were scared to breath next to each other. People were terrified of going to work and then coming home and infecting their children or elderly family members, which might kill them. AIDS didn’t rise to that level.  It’s not even comparable. 

The .com crash was a blip compared to the Great Recession and mostly affected stocks. The Great Recession shot through the housing market, the stock market, and the employment market and they didn’t recover for years. 

We have such a negative mindset now, but there was a more positive mindset in the 90s. This is probably because of the events that have happened, but also with the demise of local news and the takeover of cable news that only focuses on scaring the shit out of people or making them mad in order to generate ad revenue. ",Outrageous-Bat-9195

Economically we’ve been fucked for a while and the writing has been on the wall BUT we’ve made strides in equality and of course broader healthcare coverage and other things like more access to modern conveniences and technology.

The problem that you described is very specific, if you grew up in the 80’s or 90’s in the US as a “lower” middle class or middle class kid, things are worse for you now.

As a whole, we haven’t brought people out of lower class by raising the quality of life for everyone and providing a more stable economy or more opportunities for everyone to succeed.

We’ve actually lowered the bar so that what middle class could/should have looked like in 2020 is now even harder to achieve than it was for many decades prior.

The general population now numbs themselves because we all have smartphones and big flat screen tvs with internet access and Amazon Prime shipping and again modern conveniences…But technology being cheaper and more accessible is not the same as a higher quality of life and is not a trade off for financial security and better opportunities.

More people than ever in the US are living paycheck to paycheck…more than 3/4 of the population according to some reports.

This triggered nationwide homelessness, which has not abated since. Then put a 2016 28% tarriff on all imports, which is basically our entire economy, and then watch all of retailers and wholesalers gradually adjust their prices to cover the 28% loss. So now everything is 30%+ more experience. then we go in and bail out covid, which added $18,000 worth of tax liabilities to every American taxpayer alone. That's just the impact of Covid. And a lot of that money overstimulated the economy, it never needed to be injected into the economy in the first place. And that caused inflation to spike again.

Millenial people (they are not 'millenials', some mythic creature in your imagination) did, in actual fact, grow up and come of age in a remarkably shitty time. Worse than other bad times, maybe yes, maybe no, but from 9-11 on, American society has not been good. This is compounded by their vicious exploitation by the ruling classes and corporations. You needn't go any farther than the elimination of art and music from public school, to the cost of college education and then the rapacious structure of the student loan industry.  


But another thing that matured in the lives of millennial people is the technology of worker exploitation. The fucking over of young people in the job market is unconscionable. And, as with student loans, it's abetted by the government (though more on one side of the aisle than the other) supporting corporations *uber alles*.   


Before networked technology, it wasn't practical to manage randomized work schedules that make you work days alternating with working nights. There weren't as many jobs simple enough that firing an experience worker because they are making an extra buck an hour and you can hire a new one for less. It makes your life miserable on purpose.  


We won't talk about climate change, the unwholesomeness of food, or mass shootings every day, or etc, but they count, too. Suffice to say, I agree that things suck today and tell you that they are actual things that have been done, almost maliciously, mostly to young people.  


I also think that much of it could have been avoided. I think the older peoples' condemnation of millennial people is mostly projection. They cannot face the guilt of having wrecked the culture and the planet so they blame the victims.  


I start to say that I also apologize for my age cohort and it's bad behavior but, that doesn't capture my real feeling. I am enraged and ashamed of being part of such a rapacious, short sighted and prejudiced bunch.",tqwhite2

2024-04-04 14:29:54,ky0mys7,"The 90's were the beginning of everything falling. Economy boom from Reganomics, you even see in Season 1 episode 11 of The Simpsons that the character Adil argues with Lisa why defend a country that 5% of the people own 95% during dinner.
With just a few weeks af its being reported the top 1% owns more then 50% of the wealth. (Episode ending with Adil gifting Lisa a Guilotine). 



The reason why people idolize the 80's is because the 90's is when we started to see the effects of all the tax cutting lead to each year. Then the 00's we had 9/11 that grew distrust amongst ourselves and other people, then the recession hits and we see the government bailout a ton of companies and banks using our tax dollars. Not to mention concepts like tickle down wealth and so on.


People were warning us in the 90's and we grew up in a era of just being kids/teens enjoying the beginning of the internet and turn of the millennial. Believing our ability to thrive could only be threatened by the likes of China or Russia becoming a Superpower and overtaking us. 


You can even look at Halloween back then and Halloween each following year. Less houses having lights up = less expendable income. More control over kids with people not letting them outside running wild because they became distrustful of their society and the world. People became out of touch with their neighbors and more in tuned with being connected socially on the internet. Now you rarely see kids given the same freedoms we had because of fear of kidnappers. Or police thinking your irresponsible to let your 6-8 year olds walk to a nearby playground and be there alone playing, coming back for lunch, dinner or when the streetlights go on.


I was born in that area where I'm just before being called a Zoomer and right at the tail end of being a millennial. I got to experience and see the changes during childhood.


Boomers and Gen Xers calling us entitled were not correct because none of is were truly in the workforce or in career paths to start earning our own wealth and assets. But by then minimum wage was still not where it needed to be since the 80's, we saw the rise of colleges increasing tuition prices during the 90's onwards because everyone was told to attend college. And then when people finished college or just entering the workforce the recession comes, we saw mass layoffs and people working at fast food resturants to make ends met. While every major business got a bailout, insurance companies prior refused to cover their insurers because of hurricane Katrina, then get a government bailout and their profits sour through the roof. 


And it became a endless loop of seeing tax cuts and then the realization of the 2010's that a lot of fortune 100 corporations were paying almost $0 in taxes because of all the tax reductions, loop holes found or write offs. 


Then the US elects a billionaire* who people were ingrained with from a cable TV show thinking a rich guy could fix the economy and help the little folks out. Then we see the largest amount of consolidation of wealth, mergers galore, corruption, a president being impeached... Twice. The rise of hate groups again and then a literal black plague. That created a ton of mental health problems for almost everyone. 


The 90's weren't the exception. The 80's adults were the starting point of making those decisions that lead to the decline. But it was the 50's - 70's that were the only golden era of America. But that was only because we had oppressed 'colored people' to do low paying work to support the upper-lower to upper class. And everything was: Communism is bad. Capitalism good. And not that one helps balance the other or America should of been a mix of different political beliefs working in hand for the betterment of the whole country.


We just got to enjoy the last bits and pieces of everything. We were initially shown by Hollywood from the likes of Spider-Man that you should be proud to be poor because it was nothing but up from there. Or idolizing movies based on made up stories of people getting out of their rough situations and becoming extraordinary wealthy like The Pursuit of Happiness or The Blind Side.


The later of which we are just finding out is a fabricated story and what happened then to today is a Capitalism horror story of white people taking a bright black teen with a scholarship who was good at football, had him sign papers for conservatorship believing it was adoption papers. Then having all his wealth from playing football in control of a random white family while they immediately tap a writer to write The Blind Side and had a movie made showing their success. And now this adult man who already had a bright future was taken advantage of by a white family and started fighting for his rights and a lawsuit to the people who lied to the world they were heroes.

I agree that capitalism worked well then. My mom for example made either the same or a little less than me now, and we did well off. Now I make slightly more than she did, and things have nearly tripled in price, but wages not with it. Capitalism is definitely broken, and I say that as someone that supported the system. I think company CEOs started seeing just how greedy they coudl be and get away with it, there needs to be some kind of wage gap laws now, or it will shatter.

I will die on the hill that social media is what slowly killed things off... socially oddly enough.

I really do think that the saying ""comparison is the thief of joy"" holds true here, and the internet allows too many people to start doom spiraling while comparing themselves to others and to all of history (so long as you just stop looking any earlier than the 1950's).

The American Dream works now, it worked before, and it's always improving and changing.  People who say that it doesn't work, or trot out George Carlin like he's some wise Socrates-like sage to refute it are just defining their version of the ""American Dream"" to fit the ""it's all broken"" mindset.

My great granddad was a literal 1920's homeless hobo, hopping on trains and was in and out of jail since he was 9 years old.  He managed to turn his life around through manual labor and genuine change of heart.  His son had a lower class upbringing, joined the military and served in the Korean War, came back and worked his whole career at AT&T, first as a technician, then worked up to mid-management.  My dad was the first person in our family to go to college *ever*.  I am only the 3rd person in our family's history to go to university.

The American dream to me is just incrementally getting better despite obstacles thrown in our way by circumstance.

OK, so I'm GenX and lived through the 80's/90's to present day. First off, I feel Millennials have got a bad rap from everyone. Every generation thinks they're special and different, it's not a Millennial thing; we thought that way, baby boomers think that way, GenZ think that way it's just being young and every previous generation goes on about the latest gen being lazy and crap etc. So do I think the generations are the same? No not at all, I'm just saying the differences are way smaller than you think.

With that being said; the economy has changed in the last 50 years. You can go back further than the 90's, the economy started changing in the 70's. It's difficult for ANYONE to buy a house, get financially stable, get a stable job, get ahead on money etc. etc. So yes, Millennials are genuinely having a worse time than previous generations. As for boomers, (and possibly some of my generation :), saying ""get a job, buy a house, blah blah"". If you bought house decades ago and you've climbed that financially secure wagon then you're better off the newer generations and just can't see it.

I think capitalism has matured to extreme levels, and it only getting worse. Real pay for jobs has gone down and down. Advertising especially in tech products is absolutely predatory. I believe ""Globalization"" in the 90's was bad for everyone except business.

So it's not ""millennials"". GenZ is going to have an even harder time. When I look at Millennials I see a hard-working generation, concerned about their future, approaching middle age thinking about or dealing with families, doing everything right to get ahead and failing because of the current climate, (no pun intended).

An outstanding question is: Is there a group that was nostalgic for the 1980s, whose kids are going to be nostalgic for the 2000s, that exist in parallel but a decade off, or is it a phenomenon that skips decades?

If we suppose that parents raise kids with a 20-30 year gap between them, and therefore the period of time when the respective generations feel most nostalgic towards are on 2-3 decade offsets, then are there generations in between that are nostalgic for each of their respective decades (so people proportionally think back on the '70s, '80s, '90s, '00s, and '10s, and hear about and agree with the nostalgia for our age group), or does society in general clump up and decide which decade was best, and that decade jumps forward every twenty years or so ('70s, '90s, and presumably the '10s)?",WarAndGeese

In the meantime that housing bubble was the last big build out of affordable houses. It wasn't anywhere close to the effects from the big infrastructure projects from the 60s, 70s and 80s but it helped. 

College was still affordable, so the economy wasn't being dragged down by the student loan debt crisis yet. 

Finally companies hadn't fully completed all their mega mergers. The rule was any two companies could merger no matter how big so long as they could claim prices wouldn't go up. They were ""hiding their power level"" keeping prices low. It also helped that China still had a huge number of unemployed rural folk to draw on keeping their wages low and we were benefiting from their cheap imports as a result. Those started to dry up in the 2000s. 

There's more to this. There was a lot of deregulation going on making things worse. The big one was commodities deregulation which allowed speculators to buy things like fruits and meat and grains without taking possession of the actual physical product (that used to be illegal). That happened early 2000s and food prices jumped 5% overnight.

There are plenty of conspiracy theories about wars being started purely for money that are extremely believable (especially the middle eastern conflicts largely being for oil behind the scenes).

Our generation DOES uniquely suck. 2008 was massive. It wiped out America, and set us up to live on hard mode.

Others have mentioned AIDS and how much worse it was than we remember. This was also when the golden economic age of America really started to noticeably tilt over. It was a time when even if it was obvious you were being pretty severely abused as a child, people would look the other way. It was a time where being visibly queer was an acceptable reason for violence.

- the end of the USSR and the ""peace dividend"" of defense spending falling from 6% of US GDP to 3% https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/USA/united-states/military-spending-defense-budget

- lingering higher rates of unionization from earlier decades, though union rates were still falling

- lower housing costs, lower education costs, and the US still had a huge technological advantage compared to China which was still a very poor country.

At the same time:

- racism,  homophobia, sexism - all worse, no question

- it was still post-Reagan so his war on workers and minorities was in full swing and the social safety net was falling apart under cuts and austerity.

- Clinton pretty much embodied the ""neoliberal consensus"" that's still destroying the world hiding behind the idea that's as progressive as its possible to get.

- jobs being shipped overseas destroying the US manufacturing industry.

- growing inequality, more billionaires and less help for the poor, institutional corruptions and decaying political ability to get anything done.

- the Republicans fully embracing the far-right theo-fascist evangelical movement.

I have a very similar take with respect to Boomers for virtually the same reasons.  The US after WWII experienced unprecedented tailwinds that made it virtually impossible to fail from 1946-1965.  Europe and Asia were both bombed back to the Stone Age and lost huge population of working age people which impacted their economies for the next 25 years.  US also took all of the gold from Europe for ""safekeeping"" and then fucked everyone over by pushing for the Petrodollar as the defacto world currency.  


 These chickens didn't come home to roost until the 2000s when the rest of the developed world finally caught back up, China emerged from its Communist purge, and the middle eastern oil producing countries learned how to flex their economic muscle.

Rich tax cuts and loopholes we've ended up with a lot of wealth in the hands of very few and capitalism isn't working like it should.

I don’t think our timeline is uniquely bad, but what is unique is the constant downward slide our generation has taken over the decades without a significant time of prosperity, or upswing, when we could experience a correction of sorts. 

Things were pretty darn good when we were young and it was just starting to change for the worse as we grew into young adults. The 90s were pretty great and the life lessons we were given were based on having fairly decent decades immediately preceding our arrival & into our young adulthoods (for the Old Millenials, at least). For instance, I was encouraged to take out all of the student loans I needed for college, because wages were good and expected to continue growing so *of course* I’d be able to pay them off easily with my salary.  I was able to buy the only brand new car I’ve ever had at 23 as a grad student. I was able to afford a 1-bedroom apartment on my own while working only part-time while in grad school, no help from parents. 

You’re right, growing up in the 90s was absolutely an exception and it’s been difficult having to alter my financial expectations and behaviors over the years because the basis for all of that was set in the 90s. Instead of moving forward into better, nicer things, we’re going backwards in what we can afford.

2024-04-04 16:39:12,ky19xyy,"I want to preface by saying that the 90s were a great time in the US and Western Europe, but experiences were different around the world. For example, the Middle East still had many brutal dictators, there was still terrorism, shit was popping off in the Balkans, etc. Even in the US, the 90s had some of the worst crime rates in inner-city America with gang warfare being exacerbated by the flood of drugs and black market cash into the underground economy, i.e., crack and heroin wreaking havoc on low income communities. Much like meth and fentanyl are now, except that's spread to the suburbs and rural areas too, but I digress.

That all said, I'll focus on the US. I think the 90s had a lot of optimism because the Cold War ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the USSR. People felt excited about new emerging technologies like the Internet, cell phones, affordable home computers, cable tv, satellites, etc. America and Democracy/Free Market Capitalism/Representative Republics stood victorious over the dysfunctional slow motion trainwreck of Communism and the USSR. What's ironic is that our government didn't learn from their failures with Afghanistan and environmental disasters. 

Things were more affordable in the 90s too, and it's clear that the rise in cost of housing has upset people, especially millennials who are in their prime home buying age.

Comparing 2022 to 1994, let's look at some quick numbers. 

- 1994 US median household income: $32260

- 1994 US median home sale price: $130000

- 1994 price to income ratio: 4.03

- 2022 US median household income: $74580

- 2022 US median home sale price: $479500

- 2022 US price to income ratio: 6.43

Obviously the price to income ratio is out of whack compared to the mid 90s. We haven't seen the full impact of this yet, but historically the trend is that each peak in housing price is generally followed by a recession and lowered rates in response. Unfortunately, this recent peak is more severe than what was seen right before the 2008 crash. 

Anyways, affordability sucks for what matters in comparison to back then, so it's not all just nostalgia glasses. The same logic applies to things like the cost of education, healthcare, childcare, food, etc. 

As for technology, while we are on the cusp of having AI, robotics, nuclear fusion, quantum computing, advanced rockets, etc., it's followed by the dread that comes from the ills of social media, algorithmic content, the obsolescence of jobs due to AI, lack of privacy protection laws, smartphone addiction, and so on. Social media and 24/7 news don't help the mood either since we're all exposed to negative information and noise 24/7, if you choose to be. Social media algorithms will funnel you into negative content and doomscrolling, so of course it makes you feel bad. Crime is lower than it was in the 90s but it feels worse today because you hear about it more. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that affordability was better in the 90s and the American dream was easier to achieve. Yes, the decade wasn't perfect and had issues like we do today, but you didn't hear about it 24/7, and you didn't have social media echo chambers like we have now that absolutely drown your mental state. We are in turbulent times but we have to stay vigilant. There are many things happening that are out of our control, so try to focus on the things that you can, and improve them if you are able. Take care of yourself, your friends, and your family. We can get through this but being a doomer isn't going to help, you must find the silver lining in life.",Daynebutter

2024-04-04 16:59:58,ky1dr8m,"Clinton and Bush did a few things that were absolutely unpopular to drive down the deficit at a time when Government spending was competing with Private equity which drove up borrowing costs (interest rates).

Government spending became a non issue in the 2000s and 2010s when there were economic slumps and private equity demands had no appetites for borrowing (incredibly low interest rates and low inflation).

Now however, we are back on the same economic problem of the 90s. Regardless if you are democrat or republican, neither party wants to talk about the deficit. Republicans want to cut taxes in the same breath as saying they will cut government spending but the result is going to still inflate that deficit the same way they did it under Trump. Democrats absolutely cannot admit the deficit is a problem because they have huge social goals in mind such as better healthcare, more social programs, and rebuilding american infrastructure. No matter what your politics are, the reality is Government is competing with private equity for money that is getting more and more expensive to borrow and neither groups of leadership we have care to see it that way and all the citizens have forgotten this connection.

You all feel the inflation, you all feel the deficit but the two are not linked like it was in the 90s.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ffbFvKlWqE

Look at this debate of a three deadlocked race back in 1992. I want to focus on an aspect of the question: the questioner did not ask how unemployment or interest rates or the then-recent recession had personally affected the candidates, she asked how they were affected by the debt, a question that takes as given the idea that when the government borrows money, that has an effect on the finances of ordinary people. I’m not suggesting that ordinary voters 30 years ago had a granular understanding of the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy. But I do think a lot of voters shared the intuition that, when the government borrows a lot of money, that makes it more expensive for anyone else to buy things, especially if they need to borrow money to do it. That intuition I believe is largely lost these days to weird political bullshit like wokeism or maga.

I dont think given our political climate we can have this discussion fully. Democrats cannot admit that the Green Deals they put in place for environmental credits are costing far more than projected because on a social level, it's very prime and key to be pushing for this sort of thing. Something everyone agrees with, the government should work for its citizens and spending should be done to make lives better. To admit they need to cut the deficit means cutting these promises. Republicans however are no better and would call Bush a lying liberal these days. There is no appetite for cutting social programs, there is only tax cuts as government spending by Republicans are instead poured into bullshit like unverified PPA loans during covid that have all been forgiven granted to cronyism. (commonly accusations of welfare queens).

It isnt a big surprise to think the times when inflation was incredibly low, cost of living was low, and it felt like capitalism was working. This doesnt add on the massive disparity in CEO pay and wages staying stagnant also which is only made worse with higher inflation.",darkenspirit
2024-04-04 17:00:09,ky1dsht,"In that circumstance you described with doting, loving, responsible boomer parents it probably felt like a cocoon of happiness! 9/11 was so shocking! 

There used to be a TV series in the late 1980s -early 90s called The Wonder Years about a white teenager growing up in a suburban [middle class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class) family in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It idealized the time when the younger boomers were growing up. I suppose it was meant for them to get nostalgic about the time they grew up. 

Nostalgia sells. I happen to feel that feelings of nostalgia are not to be trusted and are short-cuts to our true feelings. Nostalgia for the past or one's childhood creates dissatisfaction in the present and leaves out important facts.

2024-04-04 17:16:11,ky1gpzn,"I think in order to appreciate the big picture it helps to understand some of the big trends happening in society and in particular the economy. 

1) Decline in manufacturing: This has been around since the 70s so certainly not new but it still means you have people today facing a more difficult situation than two generations ago. Entire communities are hit by this trend and it also fuels the next issue...

2) College Tuition inflation has gone crazy. While enrollment is way up over the generations and access has generally improved it is also a period where there is a ton of pressure to get into a good school and then a ton of pressure to pay for that school with debt. The last generation was also seeing this rise in debt but now it is a couple generations of college debt so you will see parents with college debt sending their kids to school to get more debt. 

3) Workforce success is a mixed bag. You have a lot of people doing really well and a lot of people struggling. The rate in which we are adding relatively high paying jobs is actually pretty good but the middle has dropped out and the bottom has never been good. While the income numbers may not be bad they are far less good once combined with debt and inflation numbers. 

4) Housing. Housing is tied to education and taxation. It has also become a financial vehicle. There are so many problems with housing it isn't even worth mentioning them all but in many cases the government needs to get better but people(voters) don't really want it to change and don't know how to fix it. Quagmire or our times. 

Meanwhile the South is often positioned relatively well. The decline in manufacturing didn't hit them as hard as the NE or Midwest. Businesses that want to hire a lot of college graduates can just move south and make the employees move to them. They are generally seeing population growth and the changes in income are less of a mixed bag than the north. Problems are creeping in of course but relatively better. Plus they still have space for new housing but they are often just repeating the mistake of the past.",sinofonin

The speed at which information traveled exploded when the Internet and affordable personal computing hit the mainstream in the late 90’s. Multiple 24 hour news channels sprung up and were focusing only on sensational, fear mongering,  and negative stories.

Statistically (global poverty, infant mortality…etc) things are better than they have ever been, but you would never know it.

When wages are better people are happier and spend more. When people are happier then we aren't at each others throats for every little thing and most certainly not for what political affiliation they're a part of.

It's about making sure corporations make an extra billion dollars every quarter while not paying employees who are driving that profit the wage they deserve.

But the folks from the 50's and 60's today are old if not deceased, and our more recent comparisons are with people from the 80's and 90's...and we remember those those fondly subjectively.

The theory I have is that regardless of when we are born, things always appear worse overtime because we gain responsabilities, we discover struggles and hardships that we didn't have as kids living with our parents.

In addition the economy on a macro scale has been weird, ever since we moved away from the gold standard during 1971.
Productivity per capita has increased dramatically yet living wages have not. 

A family of 5 could live on the salary of the husband alone in the 60's or 70's. Then in the 80's and 90's we needed both mom and dad to work and they had only 2 kids instead of 3. In the 2000's only 1 kid. In the 2010's no more kids a majority of people got divorced or didnt find partners. Now in the 2020's people live alone, no kids, and barely pay rent let alone have a house.

The 'Rich get more, you'll get more' concept was not new and had been soundly rejected since the Gilded Age. Try the Census Dept's ""Report on Incomes and Poverty' for a 'pretty good' timeline of the carnage. Google ""P60-273.pdf"" for some background stats.  
   
It took a 5 year long recession - 1978-1983 - during which the number of Americans below the poverty line GREW - by about 10 million or 40%! - for the first time since the Great Depression. Reagan lowered tax rates on the higher earners and borrowed the rest - US national debt was below $1 T when he took office, $2.8T when he left and has only grown since! 

Reagan also clobbered the 'personal savings rate' for most household by doubling - overnight - the FICA withholding to build the Trust fund for the retirement needs of the Boomers. He also changed the IRS regs so that interest on savings was collected yearly rather than at withdrawal. What does that do to ROI and wealthbuilding?  
  
Taken as a whole, these moves reduced the value of a hour of labor which has put living a decent life from just your own labor further out of reach that it has been since the 1920s.

Not a millenial. 

But I was around for free university education. 
Free Health Care etc.. 

Everyone built housing, the government, the private sector and even our local councils were enshrined in law that they had to provide housing according to population. By provide I mean building as well. You might have had an  area preference but you literally had to be mentally incapacitated yo not be able to access housing. Housing Supply was such that Postmen could buy houses on one income.


Then the new Neo Liberal Economics were implemented in the late 1980s and hit in the late 1990s. 

The promise was that the market would replace the state and Competition would be so wide and firece that no single entity like the government would dominate and there would be so many competitors that prices would be held down even if wages did not increase. That the private sector would build more houses, and better than the public sector. So we essentially got rid of public house building in most relevant terms. 


The 2020s is when we got the result of these experiments. 

Competitors merged, got swallowed and whole sectors are owned by a handful of mega Companies. Wages stagnated but prices increased. In housing we have been out competed by our post war forefathers who built more with less even with our incredible technology and much larger economy. The insistence of ""smaller government"" meant we threw the referee out of the game, so people started cheating, and are not even pretending to compete anymore and it's crony Capitalism all the way with dodgy contracts siphoning money from governments and massive one way bets because the taxpayers will have to Gail them out otherwise there would be catastrophic structural harm to economies.

They worked hard and did the right things for the time and that's exactly what we're doing. 

Maybe I'm just a bit too old to have felt the 00's recession. All that did for us was make homes even more affordable and we were able to stay employed. But I definitely don't think my parents had it that much easier. They paid for a large chunk of my education and are more than generous when any of their kids need some financial assistance. Now we're saving for our kids in the same way. 

I think maybe this is where the Xennial sub-generation kicks in because I just don't have the same perspective and experiances as the younger millenials.",bitsybear1727

However, I will say the economy wasn’t as great as OP thinks in the 90’s. Unemployment was pretty high in the early 90’s. It really was the beginning of the end of the middle class. Anti-union/ anti-manufacturing federal policies, especially NAFTA and the opening of trade with China (thanks Bill Clinton), destroyed US manufacturing. The erosion of real (adjusted for inflation) wages and the erosion of the middle class started in the mid to late 90’s. But, its effects have been masked, until now,  by the cheap goods from China and the tremendous rise in two income families and low interest rates. Not to mention cheap illegal labor in farming which is a humanitarian travesty against the workers.

2024-04-05 00:34:12,ky3mj8d,"I was born in 1970 and the 90s were exceptionally good, especially coming off the shitty Reagan years in the 80s.

Bill Clinton actually had the Federal government in the black if that’s believable, but it didn’t last long because of Republican policy following him that gave away the surplus in $300 checks instead of using it for something productive.

But the Clinton era was also a set up for the problems today because that boom was in part caused by allowing companies to outsource jobs and factories, which people didn’t really start feeling til a decade or two later.

While the 90s were great we also had the tech crash in the 2000s followed by the housing and bank crashes. So hidesight is a little rose tinted.

Things are definitely difficult for your generation, but you have more problems related to issues like technological advancement than just a bad economy.

Not trying to sound like that old guy but as someone that went to college in the late 80s-early 90s, you can definitely see a MAJOR difference in how people live now as compared to then.

In the 80s people didn’t have the income even you have now. When I went to college, I could count the number of students that had cars in my dorm on one hand and those cars were buckets.

Goto a college campus now every kid there has a brand new car. I think that’s the difference millennials don’t grasp.

Growing up as a teen in an urban area things were a lot worse then than now. People used to steal coats and shoes when I was a teenager. We also had crack and violence was out of control compared to now where it’s the lowest it’s been in decades.

I think millennials really should stop complaining about boomers and actually mobilize and vote themselves into power. Too many millennials imho are jaded and don’t believe in the system, but also aren’t willing to challenge the status quo and mobilize politically like the boomers did to get what they want.

Boomers mobilized politically in the 60s and 70s and shook things up.

Those gains should have been used to increase wages, improve benefits, improve working conditions, and expanding the business.

The wealthy declared class war in the 70’s and have been on a multi-front warpath to extract the middle-class gains grown in the decades between the end of WW2 and the 70’s.

Suppressing wages is one path. Lobbying for deregulation is another. Lobbying for structural changes to tax code is another. Lobbying for reduced tax spending on the IRS and other regulatory bodies is another way. Pushing Americans into daily use of credit is another way. Inventing new banking fees and penalties is another way. Replacing traditional pensions with individual 401k is one way. Lobbying to starve public schools is one half of a path; dominating school boards and getting involved in public policy or selling educational products to school districts is the other half of that path. Every bank crisis resulting in bank consolidation is a path. Demonizing public safety net programs and participants is one path. Closing facilities for the needy and driving them into the street is one way. Cutting funds to maintain aging infrastructure is one way.

Is it all intentional, a broad conspiracy? 

It doesn’t have to be: every individual action taken by the wealthy to increase their own wealth is a natural act of greed.

However, the shaping of public policy around tax code and enforcement; spending; and regulation are planned acts promoted by cooperating individuals across multiple orgs, think tanks, and grooming agencies targeting future politicians, judges, and public service officials.

The historic gains of the post-WW2 era fattened up a middle class goose with housing values, small businesses, and retirement/stock investments grown by millions of ordinary people for two generations.

Those who own the goose have merely been working to reap that harvest for the past 2 generations in a way that fools the goose into thinking better days are still ahead and “things can only go up!”",Reference_Freak

The 90s also gave us: 


Olympic Park bombing, Oklahoma City bombing, World Trade Center bombing, Unabomber bombings, Rodney King beating, LA/Watts riots, Michael Jackson and Gary Glitter exposed as pedos, Kurt Cobain suicide.


Gulf War - this is a big part of why the economy was booming, because it gave us cheap oil. Unfortunately it also pissed off a lot of people, which led to  


 the forming of ISIS 


Here's a few especially for the white middle class: 


The start of pharmaceutical companies making essentially heroin pills, which expanded the pharmaceutical industrial complex grip on media, and ultimately led to the opioid epidemic.  Big Pharma began pushing SSRIs, Columbine, Mendez Brothers, Jon Benet Ramsey.


OJ murdered 2 people and got away with it. Woodstock 99 riots,   Tupac and Biggie murdered, Nancy Kerrigan attacked, John Bobbett penis chopped off.


There were genocides in Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, which Clinton and the USA actively did nothing about.  


Bill Clinton had many more scandals than just ""a BJ"". He had multiple women accuse him of assaulting him before and during his time in the White House.  He lied to congress about his relationship with Lewinsky, and was impeached for perjuring himself.  


He also was carrying out illegal wars in Kosovo and Yugoslavia which killed millions of people.  


He was involved in the Whitewater illegal investment and money laundering scandal. 


Key witnesses and whistleblowers in Whitewater and other scandals involving Clinton wound up dead, such as Vince Foster, C. Victor Raiser, Ian Spiro, Jerry Parks, Edward Eugene Willey... the list goes on.

On dawn of Election Day 2016 I felt a yawning chasm of dread, even though I had no inkling of the fact that Trump could win. I just hated that I was still in a time/space when technically a Trump presidency could be part of my timeline.

On the subway on the way to work I listened to Live Through This in its entirety for probably the first time since I was 14 in 1994. And I thought, for the first time: wait a second. What if my profound sense of alienation during my teen years was not the fault of me, or my hometown. What if it was just...the 90s? What if they really were just awful?

The thing about the 90s is the people who benefited from capitalist oppressive systems had a better shot at being blind to the suffering of the people they exploited. And of course if you were a kid, you deserve to be protected from all that. But for the global majority of people...that was not a good time.

My mom was born in 58 and her brother was older and much more a boomer, where she had more of the dazed and confused school experience. 

My parents really struggled raising me and depended on a lot of help from both my grandparents. My mom knows how hard it was for them and understands it's gotten much harder for our generation. She blames a lot of it on people in the 80's-90's (early boomers) for living way above their means, failed trickle down economics, and outsourcing of our industry. I feel it has gotten exponentially worse as far as wage growth vs inflation and the shift in wealth share with how much wealth the richest people have. The gap has skyrocketed. For decades we have also been neglecting our infrastructure, falling behind on education, giving the rich tax cuts and breaks while the same conservatives want to cut social programs, food assistance, Healthcare, social security, and they talk about raising retirement age... At the same time the biggest corporations have had record growth and get tax cuts/bailouts whenever they need. 

Biden wants to protect Healthcare, social security, raise wages, provide tax breaks and credits for families, hold the rich and corporations to pay their share, is Rebuilding infrastructure, investing in railroad that has been neglected, bringing manufacturing jobs back, industry, and high paying trade jobs, while competing with china. Also all of the green energy advancements and getting us back on track for paris agreement goals. I hope we get 4 more years of building on that progress because so many of the issues I have seen being kicked down the road my whole life are finally getting addressed.

I don't think millennials or younger gens are weak or entitled or anything though. I just think they didn't have quite the best circumstances like we did.

Racism was cool.

My entire youth was in a relatively stable era of the 80s and 90s (born in 78). The 80s *seemed* good, but the great looting of American prosperity was underway. The 90s were just weird, but at least inflation was pretty tame and video games were awesome.

2000-present has just been one big shitshow. But at least the tech is just getting better and better. We can at least distract ourselves (and yell at each other on the internet).

2024-04-05 04:53:58,ky4lzny,"90’s sucked for me. That’s when the traditional family model started to break down and divorce was normalized. There also wasn’t nearly as much support available either and it was still taboo to complain about things, especially as a kid. 

No internet or even cell phones either. Everyone just suffered in silence and couldn’t vent anonymously on the internet. Things probably seemed a lot better than they actually were. There was still plenty of poverty. We complain now, but to me our poor people have it better than ever.

When I was a kid in the 90’s, if you were poor you didn’t have a working car. You didn’t have a cell phone, internet, video games, or even cable. You had one or two pairs of shoes, usually from Payless or Walmart and a bunch of GoodWill clothes. You also didn’t dare ask for these things either because your single parent was constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown.

About the only good thing was that there really wasn’t much to do and it forced you to interact with people and make friends. Your leisure time was spent in a public library just so you could play Oregon Trail and read books. Either that or you were outside with other kids using your imagination.

With that said, I’m so glad I went through that though. I truly feel like the standards were highest for my generation. Even some of the dumbest kids in class could do shit even average kids can do today…you know, like read at your grade level.

I really feel like 2000’s+ kids are fucked. So many kids are getting diagnosed with psychological issues and/or taking fucking psych meds Behavioral therapy in elementary school? WTF? This is not how people are suppose to feel. Then combine that with fact that many of them are going to be in crippling debt for the rest of their lives. I think in many ways it’s much easier to be poor now than it was in the past. That said, they’re never going to share the things my generation (and lower) got to experience in life.

I’m in my mid 30’s now and have been very fortunate and successful; however, I can mainly attest that to getting the right people in my life. It was the biggest difference maker for me. Finding someone who loves you and them having a good family who can show you another way. Nudging you in the right direction. And I think that’s what’s lacking in society today.

I was a 4th grader who struggled to be decent in school (undiagnosed adhd as a girl…) and suddenly my mom had to go to work for the first time in my life. She worked full time at that same job until a few years ago. 

Things sucked, and growing up in the bay area I got used to the feeling that sometimes things are “good” so save you money and try to breathe knowing that at any moment things could turn real bad with a shift in the economic winds. During hard times  - 1992, 2001, 2008, 2016, 2020, 2023 (…) - we try to spend less money and still remember to breathe…

I can see how the 90s were generally good to more people than other decades, but tbh it’s been some kind of shit show since I can remember. The thing I keep thinking is “why do we think we DESERVE happiness? And why is happiness always out of reach?” 

I think there’s a toxic idealism in the US: “times were always better before”, “back in the day,” etc. which prevents most from realizing that animals have never been “happy.” Life is stress, and looking at snapshots of time never shows the FULL picture. Sure, more high school grads could afford homes in the 1950s. Also in the 50s women were expected to be perfect SAHMs, men had to be stoic breadwinners, nobody could divorce without one or both being ruined, people of color couldn’t live, buy homes, or even exist near white neighborhoods without possibly being lynched, LGBT people expected to get beaten to death for loving someone, and EVERYONE smoked, drank, and took all kinds of crazy drugs just to get by. Fuck.

It’s hard to survive, and it would be great if things got easier for common folks, but millions of years of every creature striving tells me that things can and eventually will always seem terrible af. Shit, I’m pretty sure even billionaires aren’t really “happy” because we’re conditioned to always WANT more than we have.

There was the OJ Simpson trial and major threat of riots.  The 90's started off with a recession with nearly a 20% loss on the stock market, and years later the oil market crashed leaving people like my dad and many of my friends' dads unemployed.  Then there were major overreaches by the government.  There was the Waco Branch Davidians.  Crazy people, yes, but surrounded for 51 days by the government, shot at, and eventually burned to death was a clear overreach and abuse of power.  There was also the Ruby Ridge incident in which a man's son was shot on his own property by stooges, and his wife was killed with sniper fire while holding her infant, all approved by the acting AG.  The Lewinsky incident is hardly the most controversial thing that happened in the 90's, you just don't know about it or forgot about it.  The bigger Clinton scandals never made the mainstream news.  There were many, many riots throughout the 90's.  There was organized gangs that seemed to be all the news talked about most of that decade.  We had the Persian Gulf War, the Oklahoma City b####ng.  We had major emotional trauma when Seinfeld came to an end, and the Spice Girls became a thing.

That all compounded to create an amazing standard of living for most people.

2024-04-05 11:05:54,ky5jd92,"Very insightful. As a boomer, who always listened to younger generations and helped them get on air or their ideas into the mainstream, I have to say that since the Nineties, corporations with political corruption rigged the system against Gen X and Millennials. The Sixties and Seventies were the Renaissance for the U.S., compared to now, regardless of wars, because wealthy people paid  40% tax and there was still a thriving middle class. The G.I. Loans paid for college, you could buy a home in one income and things were very affordable and logical and society had etiquette standards where greed and corruption was well hidden and less common. My dad was a doctor that refused to deal with insurance, made house calls and gave the poor and elderly a discount on their bill, or they could work it off, cleaning for him. My kids gloried in the Nineties, in spite of the Eighties “Greed is Good” and excess decade, because the Nineties made having a conscience cool and hip. Wired Magazine ruled and warned us of things to come and estimated when diseases would be cured but now that day never came, Bug Pharma paid off the new discoveries that were inconvenient to their bottom line. Minorities that had gone to law school ‘to help their people’ and kids that became MBA!s in the 80’s were now working full time to add red tape and laws to screw the consumer. The Nineties gave us the first people to think outside the box though: Gen X. An incredible bright generation to herald in Millennials but like Boomers, not quite sure how to fight “Corporations are People” or the evil “Patriot Act,” or exorbitant campaign donations and lobbying, in an age where people now go to Washington to become millionaires. But we can’t give give up, please don't! . I’m so sorry for this jaded corrupt crap world we gave you but you can bring common sense and fairness back by making your corner of the world work and demanding more through change. I will be right next you, voting for change, student loan debt cancellation, free junior college, Medicare for all, affordable housing laws, taxing the rich, all of it because give money to other countries who have that and you deserve that.",Sungirl8

**Movies**: For films harry potter and lord of the rings were OLD movies. It was the golden marvel era! Which again has now gone to shit.

Netflix was $10 a month and was all you needed for a lot of people.

2024-04-07 01:38:27,kyeq7zq,"In the 1990s, the U.S.A. enjoyed all of their hard earned gains from the 1980s, where people fought through the two recessions in the early 1980s, 13%+ inflation (1980), and high interest rates to combat inflation under Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker. Credit cards were popularized for average people in the 1990s when median real wages stagnated until 1998. After Volcker got forced out, Alan Greenspan undid Volcker's hard work and unleashed cheap debt for the masses. 

In 1994, President Clinton signed NAFTA and formalized the growing weakness of U.S. manufacturing and other productive industries. In 1999, Clinton signed Financial Services Modernization Act, which ended Glass-Steagall and legalized the combination of investment and commercial banking operations. This accelerated the financialization of the U.S. economy. The party ended in 2000 when the Tech Bubble burst. All the cheap debt and insane speculation on unprofitable tech companies unraveled. Then, Greenspan and the Fed propped up the financial system with more cheap debt. The financial sector expanded, and the housing market turned into the next casino, which blew up in the 2007-09 Great Recession. As a result, Bernanke and the Fed dropped federal funds rate to near zero to fuel cheap debt to backstop the bank losses. In recent years, COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns halted the economy, which led to government spending funded by Federal Reserve money printing. Now, the Federal Reserve is draining out the COVID-era printed money, which is slowing down inflation and the economy. 

In the 2000 Tech Bubble burst, we lost decent paying jobs. In 2007-09, we lost jobs and homes. Now, we are staring at $12 trillion+ home loans, \~$1.555 trillion car loans, and \~$1.7 trillion student loans. I wonder what we will lose this time around when the financial markets collapse. We might be staring at the same stagflation era of the 1970s and/or Japan's Lost Decades era.",markthelast
2024-04-07 04:26:32,kyfckiz,"The other thing to bear in mind is that when you're young you don't understand the greater contexts of the world. 

Our education system, in America, conceals certain aspects of American history too. Remember learning about the history of Thanksgiving in like elementary/middle school? ""We made friends with the Indians and shared a meal!""

Then you get to high school/college and your teachers are like ""okay...so...sorta... but we also murdered the fuck out of the native americans and ruined their culture and lives over the following generations, and still do to this day.""

So, part of why we see the past as ""better"" is simply that you/we didn't know better. You didn't have the responsibilities of an adult either, so your view is generally gonna be more care free.

Then, as you get older, you start seeing more problems in the world. You learn more of the unfiltered history of our country and the world at large. You have to personally deal with your problems instead of having a parent do it for you. 

I was born in '87. I loved being a kid in the 90s. But it wasn't some idyllic landscape of peaceful times. We just didn't know better. And the lack of internet, and 24/7 news outlets, just made it easier to ignore stuff. 

That said, we're definitely in a rough patch, socially. Lots of new technology that the general populace doesn't know how to navigate. Stagnate wages. Etc etc etc. But it's just the same problems of the past with a new look/aesthetic. Societal timelines spiral; history doesn't exactly repeat itself, but it definitely rhymes.

If you look at his work you can see a direct line from his refusal to work with Democrats in the 90s to where we are today with a totally dysfunctional 2 party system.

Additionally, remember that climate change was discovered under Ford and then each subsequent president including Clinton just kicked the can down the road. The first presidential candidate who even wanted to talk about it was Gore, and he won, but had the election stolen by Bush 2.

Clinton also was on board for the terrible war on drugs that mass incarcerated primarily people of color for minor drug offenses.

During the 90s globalism was also really taking hold and lots of manufacturing jobs were being transfered overseas.

Personally, I also was not a fan of the creative stagnation of mainstream comic books from the 90s. It turned from a really vibrant and creative art form into a mass market property that needed to always be the same to support animation driven toy lines. 

Musically we had some interesting turns, but the over emphasis on authenticity pushed some really talented digital musicians out of the industry.

--my parents being too poor to have a place when I was 4 so we lived in my grandparents attic
--after as a toddler living in the apartment of my other grandparents, where my grandma died of leukemia but at least I got to go to the beach
--as a baby living in a couple apartments with pest infestations 
--then when I started kindergarten living in more apartments where there were kids everywhere and we hung out in the neighborhood where lots of kids were picking up the old cigarette butts to ""smoke"" them, and I found some random drug paraphernalia on the street, and there was a neighborhood chicken pox party 

--my aunt had an exchange student from Russia. An aunt an uncle spent some time in Russia. Heard about how much worse it was then so I too, grew up knowing how special the 90s were in the US despite not having any of the experiences these middle class millennials seem to remember 

--at the end of the 90s my parents had finally saved up enough to get a small house in the boonies a long commute away from work. We had it for under a year. It was unfinished. I helped with some of the work to try and finish it. My dad was really proud of the time he was able to put in. We had to foreclose in under a year. 

--then our finances were already ruined due to that in advance of the dot com bust

So yeah. Glad some of you middle class fuckers had a great 90s

He exploited the technology to make speeches to the camera, not to the empty room, the viewer didn't know the room was empty. 

This lead to news services picking up the feed and pulling the sound bites to use in their, relatively new, 24 hour news service (CNN was the first cable news and came about in the mid-80s). This started us on the path of politics being this boring thing no one paid much attention to into the entertainment industry it is today. 

The 24 hour news is now purely entertainment. The thrive on controversy, the profit on dysfunction. We eat it up. Politics should be boring because policy IS boring. We shouldn't be following it like a sports team. We definitely shouldn't know more about the few members that exploit the system to their benefit than we do about our own representative.

Columbine had the most fatalities, but there were at least two other ""major"" school shooting events prior to it.) \*\**Please note: in NO WAY am I minimizing the horrors that unfolded at Columbine, I remember vividly the news broadcasts about it and it was absolutely terrifying and heartbreaking to see.

Gore had gotten just hundreds of thousands of the popular vote ahead of Bush, and the Electoral College was also split to where Bush barely eked out the 270 needed to be President (271 vs Gore's 266).

However, when it came to voter turnout in 2000, it was around a third of the US population.

This is why having many voting options is important to ensure that voter turnout is as high as it can be. I can understand that some voting options have their degree of security scrutinized or argued for, but that is also why a balance on what constitutes a legitimate vote has to be formally and lawfully agreed upon. The problem is that we have 50 states' who have their own way of doing votes for Presidential Elections, when it would make sense to get them all on board with the same standard. Leave the local elections, anything State related, to them to worry about, but develop a means to ensure that the next leader of the United States is voted on based on a set of standards, voting options, and ensuring voter turnout can be as high as possible (not everyone will be out on Election Day to vote, but we can still give them the means to send a vote in so they can do something else that day as needed).",TheLaughingMannofRed

2024-04-04 15:21:29,ky0vsjj,"Housing costs are in the inflation rate. Obviously, housing prices have risen faster than inflation. So have many other things like healthcare and tobacco. On the other hand, many things have risen in price slower than the rate of inflation, like food, clothing, and energy. The inflation rate is the aggregate of the price changes for a representative basket of goods. Housing prices are definitely higher, especially in some parts of the country, but those higher housing prices are generally offset by lower prices elsewhere.

One thing that I don't believe is reflected in the inflation adjustments is changes in social expectations. For example, in 1994 it was common for an entire household to share a single phone line. Now, everyone expects to have their own phone line. Phone lines my be cheaper now, but we probably spend a greater share of our income on them. The same is true for many things like Internet service, streaming video channels, and a host of other things that are common and expected today that we simply didn't have or rarely purchased in the 1990s. I suspect that our expectations for our standard of living have increased faster than incomes by enough that we feel poorer today even though by objective measures we are richer.",musing_codger
2024-04-04 16:41:57,ky1ag80,"I don’t think obesity has been normalized at all. Maybe it looks that way on social media, but social media is not real life.

In real life, obese people are still treated with disdain and disgust.

Although people generally aren’t as mean to fat people as they used to be, they still aren’t nice to them, and some people are still just as mean. As someone who has been 113lbs-228lbs, people are much nicer and more interested in me the smaller I am (I’m not even talking romantically). 

I don’t think obesity should be celebrated, but it also shouldn’t be shamed. Shaming people who are obese doesn’t help them; it’s no different than shaming someone with any other health problem. 

It’s not polite or acceptable to provide unsolicited advice for other peoples’ health problems, and it’s certainly not ok to shame someone for their health problems. 

Would you shame someone for skin cancer because they didn’t wear enough sunscreen and spent too much time at the beach? Why is that not ok, but it’s ok to be mean to someone who is struggling with obesity?",tsunadestorm

It goes even further, this new blurry line of worker vs consumer, when we talk about the economics of off-shoring manufacturing and utterly reliant on immigration for FARMING in the US. 

No ApP or AI existing today or the future is going to replicate the time, practice, and knowledge of craft.

I studied a bench trade and the future of that trade in ""digital tools"" and after nearly two decades out, trying to use my ""digital tools"" in the workforce (which I reject) has led to - not being able to continue using those tools without constant interruption of ""updates"" and increasing expense to ""lease"" these tools with a ridiculously expensive subscription now instead of the annual cost of software that didn't need to be repurchased for a few years.

So cost of living has increased 75%, while median wage has only increased by about 40-50%, state to state in the US. 

Still leaving a deficit of about a quarter. 

Credit card debt had a high peak in the 90s as well, as consumer credit was more available, particularly prior to 2008. Mortgage availability was also much of a lower bar before the subprime era.

Because they were.  They're an exception, to be clear.  For most people, life improves as you age.  But they're also not wrong.  Quality of life WAS better in the 90s.

The Boomer generation is living about the easiest life of any generation of humans to ever live.  They had struggles too, but theirs were relatively minor compared to what the young of today are facing (and to what their parents faced).  Student loan debt, medical costs, and housing being the biggies.  During their young (poor) years, there was almost no student loan debt and medical/housing costs were extremely reasonable relative to today.  Now, as they reach old age, they are paying more for care, but they're also benefiting massively from technological improvements in medicine.  They ""raped"" about $60 trillion from the public trust too, hence why the young today are loaded up with loans.  Your debt is their benefit received and not repaid.  The national deficit is mostly a product of propping up failed Boomer businesses while they obesified the housing market.  The average house today is too big, and requires too many resources.  That's your housing shortage.",flyinhighaskmeY

It wasn’t the recession that wiped people out financially - it was the debt crisis and mass foreclosures and credit freezes. 

That was the only way we could economically deal with decades of stagnant wages. 

The 90s through 2008 was the golden age of consumer credit. That’s where a lot of rosy glow of consumer spending power relative to today came from. 

In real money terms, not imaginary terms in re lines of credit, we’re far worse off than we were during the 70s when recession, and never truly recovered from the subprime crisis on either a consumer credit or real estate level. That’s what we got for selling our collective soul to bail the banks out. 

We precluded what would’ve likely been very close to an economic depression, but at the cost of a “ghost” depression. 

Consumer credit lines and mortgage lines were slashed, leaving people to pick up the balance on wages that haven’t remotely followed inflation since the 1960s. 

There’s no actual depression. No real recession at the moment. 

But for the average consumer - it feels like we’re in one, due to decreased discretionary spending power. The adjusted consumer spending rates aren’t accounting for wage stagnation and labor market value deflation - because we’re still using measurements that were built when large amounts of consumer credit was the norm.

I used to be a pizza delivery driver and like once a year i would pay 500 bucks for a car and would run it into the ground.  My car payment on a used car back then was 150 a month for a used car (with the car probably only about 3-4 years old) and now my payment is 468 dollars a month for a 10 year old van.

Were there social issues in the 90's?  Of fucking course there were.  Are we feeling nostalgic for a time when life was easy?  Of fucking course we are.  Economically, were things better in the 90's and the early 00's?  Yes, they absolutely were.

Passports are only valid for 10 years. Plenty of people have expired passports (e.g. my in-laws don't have valid passports, but have been to more than 5 countries each). You also didn't need a passport until recently for Canada/Mexico travel and still don't need a passport when visiting Caribbean countries on a cruise.

The 90s were coming out of a recession, so the effects of that were still a thing. Then, maybe, the money from the tech boom kept it ""stable"" by shuffling people around, until it, too, went bust. Maybe a bit like 90s manufacturing was turning into a game of musical chairs. Chairs were moving overseas but other sectors like tech were adding new chairs until... they weren't.

Somewhat interesting from Mar 1992:

https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/1992/ec-19920301-is-the-rust-belts-revival-real

tl;dr: 

> ...it could be that a major restructuring in the region's trade sector is still
waiting to be triggered by a more severe
downturn in other sectors. Thus, the turn-around in the trade sector might not
recur if demand for exports is weak in
the next recession and if construction
then is no healthier in the Great Lakes
than nationally.

And we know there was a severe downturn in tech, and (I think I am safe to assume) export demand was getting weaker not stronger.

And this article from Jan 2001:

https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jan-07-mn-9425-story.html

> It’s an area that once was called the Rust Belt for its deteriorating, vacant factories, but in the 1990s it enjoyed enormous prosperity as Americans bought more cars and trucks than ever before. Indeed, the Fort Wayne unemployment rate, though edging upward, remains below the national average of 4%.
>
>But now there is evidence that this manufacturing region might already have slipped back into recession. All along Interstate 69--which slices through this city of 202,000--are smaller towns that supply windshields, steering wheels, wiring assemblies, pistons and engine mounts to the auto industry and are feeling the pinch: places called Angola, Ashley, Auburn--and that’s just the A’s.
>
> ...the pain in Indiana is widespread. The state accounts for one-fourth of the nation’s steel production, and such producers as U.S. Steel, Bethlehem Steel and Ispat International--big suppliers to Detroit--have laid off workers here in recent weeks. On Dec. 27, LTV Corp., the nation’s third-largest steelmaker with a huge mill in northwestern Indiana, declared bankruptcy.

From the 1830s onward, the Penny press began to play a major role in American journalism. Technological advancements such as the telegraph and faster printing presses in the 1840s also helped to expand the press of the nation as it experienced rapid economic and demographic growth. Editors typically became the local party spokesman, and hard-hitting editorials were widely reprinted.”

This is the correct answer!

I know it makes no sense and is a head-banger of a conundrum, but the practice is rooted in (not so) good faith on the strength of those who came before you that abused the system.

The process is subjective, and decisions are arbitrary. There are no study guides or formulas that are guaranteed to lead to success. You are young and have no substantial ties or compelling reason to return to Ecuador other than your word.

My urging you to not give up is based on the fact that eventually you will be in front of a different interviewer, with a different disposition and perhaps with a better objective assessment of your situation. Your profile doesn't look like it will change anytime in the near future (youth, employment, and individual finances), so the only ""x"" variable is the Consular Officer.

Keep in mind that your total application history will be visible, so maintaining some sort of consistency is highly advisable... i.e. don't bounce around between applying for this visa type and that visa type, giving the impression of ""gaming the system""

2024-04-04 02:24:12,kxydv13,"Very well done with your presentation, OP!

I can definitely join you in prayer, I don't get the fasting part, but, the Muslim community will be wrapping up Ramadan next Wednesday and celebrating Eid, fasting daily until then. Don't know if there's a correlation but, the importance of the crescent moon in their religion would be very similar to a solar eclipse.

Your advice to ""Get right with God"" is never a bad idea.  Whether you are Christian, Jew, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindi, or even Pagan, all have the commonality of believing creator(s) are at the top of their respective belief systems.

Your advice to ""Warn people"" is not bad, either, but, in order to communicate effectively, I wouldn't recommend pounding it out to friends and relatives that we'd call ""normies"" here.  I'd say finesse your warnings, but, definitely make them.  The point is, you want them to receive the information rather than discount it on it's face without any discernment.

Your advice to ""Prepare"" is never a bad idea.  When the Y2K panic was full steam by end of 1998, that's when I started examining vulnerabilities.  Even back then so many parts of our daily lives were relying on data, communication, electricity and technologies that are taken for granted, yet very vulnerable.  A chain reaction of an interruption of the power grid can easily be compared to losing power in a bad storm.  But, when you do, do you even have a candle?  Matches?

Preparation for losing power for a week is always a good thing.  A little investment in some camping gear, canned foods, candles, board games/cards, books, batteries, etc. along with a little cash on hand (a couple hundred bucks in small bills) is a great start!  It will put you ahead of more than 75% of your friends and neighbors.  

One thing you didn't mention is that this is an election year in the U.S.  A contentious one at that.  And one of the ONLY things that can suspend having that upcoming election is a declaration of Martial Law.  Which can only be imposed with great chaos.  And if it's chaos that's needed, we will get it, like it or not.

Another point you didn't mention is the push towards global governance.  BUT, it's the first world countries citizenry that are delaying the implementation.  I'm really not finding ANYONE, ANYWHERE anxious to replace their burger with bugs.  However, get some really good chaos started, and you'll end up eating grubs when the delicate food chain goes down.  It is common knowledge that grocery stores don't really keep more than 3 to 7 days of supply on their shelves at any given time.  And I haven't seen an abundance of restocking in anticipation for Monday at my local chain.

Overall, this community should always be on the side of presentations like yours, OP, and include sensible calls to action for spreading to our friends and families.  And you did a pretty good job of it, kudos!

The religious minded people call it ""end times"" and have all their biblical prophecies relating to catastrophic weather events and more 


The science minded people call it global warming or a shifting climate with catastrophic weather events 


The spiritual people say it's an ascension event where the timeliness split and we go from 3d to 5d and talk of end times like catastrophies


Conspiracy minded people say gov controls weather events, creates chaos and is run by satanic elite


News outlets media outlets pop culture music artists cartoons like the Simpsons all show predictive programming material that all has a similar tone (satanic themes, catastrophic weather events, ufos, prophecies. etc)


All angles point to events with a similar tone basically stating dire events will  occur that change humanity forever.

When I was a teenager I had a vision one day and thereafter angels spoke to me and told me I must have named myself Doom Bringer or DB. 

DB is the same first two initials as DB as in “DB Cooper” who arguably was the Doom Bringer of the bank notes that were never recovered. 

Also Doom Bringer is the name of an evil demon from popular video game Diablo. 

Source: Electronic Gaming Monthly

Also DB stands for douche bag which is the historic container for which douches used in the 15th century Croatia and Egypt were kept. 

Also if you reverse DB you get BD which represents the sound “bee dee” which aligns with the ancient popular phrase “teegle bee dees” which refers to ancient examples of Big Booba and Ancient Astronauts.

It makes me think about the Hunger Games. I've noticed masks are cheap right now and so are other supplies. I hope they're not betting on who will survive but if they are, God will have justice. 

The border is a real crisis. Apparently there are sleeper cells coming in from other nations. I'm not ready for war but I trust in God. I've been in situations where I was surrounded in danger and God protected me - not because I'm special or worthy but because of what Jesus did on the cross and God's generous heart. All who call upon Him will be saved. Amen.

You are very well informed. People laugh because they aren't connected with higher power or keeping up with this information, but like I said in my original post, those who serve the leaders of good or evil are warned. Devil worshipers are on the wrong team and they're going to lose and pay the price. Followers of Jesus might not always have it easy, but in the end, God wins. He is slow to anger, merciful and kind, allowing for many to repent, but when He decides it's enough, He will judge righteously.

Those who choose the wrong side will get caught up in the warfare. Due to how many things seem to be hanging on by a string, this is truly a matter of life or death.

2024-04-04 05:04:15,kxyy7nm,"OP, thank you for your response, and I do understand and respect your perspective.

But, it is very important to also be kind to all humanity and not withhold good advice or information if they are not willing to accept the core of your message.

Religions, IMHO are a valuable tool to establish a moral code within a society, but, also to impose controls on that very society as well as possibly being in conflict with the true tenets of their chosen faith.

And because in that installation of a religion into a person, there is much emphasis on ""theirs"" being the ""only"" pathway to God and Heaven.  Wars have been fought over religions, and death has been caused in their name.  

The Bible is laid out as the angry God of the Old Testament and the loving God of the New Testament.  BUT, other religions mention Jesus as a Prophet or Teacher, giving credence to his very existence, but discourse over his role with God.

Christianity preaches His tolerance and acceptance.  Of the lepers, the prostitutes, the non-believers, the sinners.  Those who want to emulate His words and His teachings NEED to find ways to give testimony to their faith in the most evangelical way possible.  To plant the seeds of that faith.  Not withhold them, nor beat others over the head with the harvested crop of that belief.

Your response doesn't need to resonate with me, I subscribe to Christianity in my personal life.  BUT, I also would have empathy for all humans, especially since the vast majority of us do believe in a creative force.  We can discourse and disagree over who's religion is the only pathway upstairs if we want to, but, in my theological studies, I've come to the conclusion that the Book of Thomas is most accurate, and therefore, the most suppressed.  Matthew 18:20-22 glosses over why.

Yet, that story of turning over the tables of the money changers in the temple (you know, today they'd call it a ""Bake Sale"" or ""Bingo Night"") is what impacted me most, in combination with all of the decisions of the Nicean Council regarding which ""Gospels"" would be chosen, yet all of the Apostles wrote one.  We got 4 of 12 for the finished product.

The Book of Thomas, overall, sums it up best, regardless of it's omission from the Top 4, God is Love.  Jesus is Love.  Love each other.  Church is a house we can gather at to worship, yet, it isn't as critical as believing, and loving.

And in that spirit, I replied to your post for the good of anyone reading, not just those who choose to follow Jesus.  We are all human.  We are all God's children.  Some of us may be considered ""prodigal"" or having ""lost their way"", but, all are created in His image.

And if we are only allowed to pray to Jesus, we are not harnessing the full potential and power of prayer.  To pray to the God at the top of ALL religions has better odds on facing the evil than splintering it to Jesus, Muhammad, Moses, Shiva, Vishnu, Buddah, etc.  I think if we all ask the dude at the very top, we may get our critical and collective prayer answered.

2024-04-04 05:04:16,kxyy7om,"With all due respect, and I say this to anyone of a differing faith from mine, I’m a Muslim by the way. The closest men on this earth to Jesus (Peace be upon him) are Muslims today, not even the Christians themselves come close to him. 

You call on Jesus, I call on his Creator, and so did he (peace be upon him). 

Your initial post (at the top, along with this guys comment you’re commenting on) really got me thinking, but after your comment on how spreading the word of Jesus will liberate people, and **only** through Jesus (PBUH) you say, I have to prove you simply are wrong.

As you’re passionate about your faith and I am about mine, I’d like to highlight to you what exactly I mean:

- analogy: if your neighbor was a murderer, would you sacrifice your own son (if you had one) and let him get killed so your murderer-of a neighbor can get off his charges? Heck no 😅 God doesn’t even have a son, but it wouldn’t make sense at all, you get this from the analogy, right?
- Go on any given street in the US of A and wear a shirt saying as heinous things about Jesus (PBUH), the folk would do nothing. Do the same about Muhammad (SAW), I bet the guy won’t make it down the street without some sort of confrontation or even altercation.
- The US is apparently a Christian state? Check the latest press release regarding Eastern, remember how they called it a “transgender day of visibility ” something something?

My point is: there are sooo many contradictions and things that simply don’t make sense in todays Christianity, and it’s become so open to anything and everything like the LGBTQABCDEFG that it stands for everything but simultaneously for nothing anymore. Get what I mean? And I don’t mean this in an offensive way at all bro.

If Jesus truly died for all of man’s sins, then why would Islam spread? And have billions of followers? Why the Qur’an? Why is it the fastest growing religion worldwide? Well billions of people are Muslims, meaning there’s got to be a reason billions are. And most Muslims **arent even** arab btw haha. Get what I’m saying?

Religion is beautiful, and it can be understood. And the truth behind **all** abrahamic faiths lie in one simple fact: God is One, He wasn’t born nor does He beget. No one can be compared to Him, He is the Absolute One. Not in 1/3 or 1/1000. One and one only. 

Abraham, Noah, Joshua, Solomon, Moses, Aaron, David, Khidr, Jesus (Peace be upon them) and Muhammad (Peace and blessings be upon him) all worship God, in absolute monotheism.",Cute_Rich7774
2024-04-04 19:14:31,ky22qg6,"Two psychology masters, Jung and Freud shared many observations, but with starkly different interpretations.  

Kind of like the sub-groups of religion, as example. Protestant, Catholic, New Age, 7th day Adventist, Mormon, Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, Episcopalian, etc. and their nuances vs. commonalities of Judaism and Islam, of which have even MORE sub-groups within themselves.

I continue to contend that the Universe holds dichotomies and polar opposites throughout it's design.  Yin/Yang.  Left or right, right or wrong, up or down, etc.  When it comes to God, there is great good.  The converse, of course, would be a devil figure, the embodiment of it's dichotomy, evil.

However, our species holds cognitive dissonance, should we choose to explore it (yes or no, in dichotomy), as well as the ability to choose to adapt and integrate, or rebel and stay our course.

Duality is what we are, by design.  However, granted the freedom of choice to decide for ourselves if we choose to throw the scale to one side, or the other.  More vice than virtue, and vice versa.

In real life, there is no pathway to ""get rich quick"".  Every ""opportunity"" to do so is rife with failure and regret.  Yet, there remains truth to hard work paying off, more often than not.  It is only the very few, who's ancestors made many sacrifices to obtain wealth that can create a wealthy environment for their offspring.  More often than not the offspring squander opportunity by their own sloth, or ineptness for use of cunning and other factors to preserve that wealth.  The adage of ""Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men and weak men create hard times"" is a doomed history we are in the process of repeating.

And sprinkled in to that hamster wheel are the evil intentions of a few souls that have long gone astray from anything culture or tradition based, in favor of narcissism and ego.

So, I agree with you, in part, and disagree as well.  What we see is subject to interpretation of the individual and their knowledge base and experiences to craft their position.  In this case, I more align with Freud, and stand behind the criticality of my own observations - - something wicked this way comes. . . sooner than later.",Candy_Store_Pauper

As I sat at my desk watching ""Good Morning, America"" on 09-11, I had no idea what was unfolding.

BUT, the instant the second tower was hit, because of my jaded theorist attitude, I immediately knew it was something big.  And, shortly after, as ""passports"" were found in NYC, and a little hole of damage from a big plane at the 5 sided building, along with a very suspicious debris field over in the field got all of my attention.

Being aware that there are predictions, many of them MIGHT play out, however, many of them won't.

Think we are super smarty big brains that know something and have data! That's the comedy of this tragedy.

2024-04-04 08:00:44,kxze320,"Telling someone who believes and knows Jesus is the way the truth and life, to not just pray to Jesus, or there’s many paths to god, is just a slap in the face to that person.

OP was saying “Jesus” Himself has saved him multiple times and using His name has actual power. I have seen it and used it many many times.

Not using Buddha or any other name but Jesus. There is no foundation to a universalism mindset, yes it sounds like a great idea to most people but it’s just comprised of people trying to figure it all out.

There is no other belief that stood the tests of time and has so much historical and archeological evidence than Christianity.

2024-04-04 07:35:58,kxzc3b3,"I recognize and acknowledge the compassion in your words and I'm grateful for your response. Thank you for taking the time to have this discussion with me. I can tell by how you speak that you advocate for love, however this manner in which you spread love can have eternal consequences. You say that we can ""disagree upstairs"" but God is very clear that only He can save. 

Isaiah 45:22 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.

John 3:16-18
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

Acts 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

If I didn't almost die as a direct result of my sin and get saved after crying out for mercy, I would probably have a very similar perspective as you. I would rather keep to myself or if I speak up, speak up for all to have equality and love. Now that I know that this isn't a matter of personal opinion, but it is in fact life or death and I learned the hard way that there is only one way, truth and life; I will share what I hope will preserve lives at the expense of my reputation. 

Jesus preached repentance - not acceptance. 

Luke 5:31-32
31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.
32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

John 5:14 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.

The God of the Old Testament and the New Testament are the same. He is holy, righteous, just, merciful and loving. The difference is that in the beginning, God used many laws for people to keep themselves clean. They made a business out of it and prioritized the law over the result God wanted: love, justice and mercy. Then He prophesied that a Messiah would come to save His people. The Messiah came and gave Himself as a spotless sacrifice that would do away with all sacrificing - effectively placing the emphasis and importance not so much on laws but on faith. Now salvation relies more on God's Son and not so much on people. However, He still wants us to follow His commandments : love God with all of our being and love our neighbor as ourselves. 

James 2:14, 26
14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

Revelation 22:14-15
14 Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.
15 For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.

I have been very stupid and wicked in my lifetime. I needed to repent or else I was going to suffer and die. I cried out for mercy and God saved me. I don't want anyone to suffer or die. I don't want anyone to be rejected by Jesus, the Son of the living God. 

Matthew 5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

Matthew 7:21-23
21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

The reality is that He taught holiness and our current day and age has watered that down to be politically correct. I'm not here to play government games. I want everyone to be saved even at the expense of people liking me. If this message helps someone to avoid consequences, then it was worth my time and effort. 

Of course we are only human and we make mistakes. What Jesus did on the cross is enough for anyone to be saved - even those who sold their soul can find hope in God through Jesus... But we must turn from our sins! To continue on sinning as we claim faith in God is like claiming that we love someone as we watch them walk straight to their demise. Sometimes real love doesn't feel good, like eating healthy or a parent telling their kid not to walk outside in the dark, but in the end, if we don't sacrifice comfort to do the right thing, the person we were unwilling to tell the truth to will be the one to suffer due to our lack of effort. 

Ezekiel 3:18-21
18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
20 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.

In the end, we are each held accountable for our morality. 

Proverbs 27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.

I am nothing and nobody and I had to learn my lessons the hard way after being a stubborn brat all my life. It wasn't until I almost died that I changed. May God be glorified if I say or do anything right. I'm far from perfect.

Thank you for presenting your side of it, hope you get to go back and read mine.

The Holy Qur'ran has its interpretations by Shia and Sunni.  Although they have many similarities, they also have some very stark differences.  If I were ever to become Muslim, I'd probably align myself more with the Shia teachings and philosophies.  

They are more tolerant, but, as I said in my response, we all really need to stop levying these charges of ""mine is the ONLY pathway"" and keep an open mind that we're just not 100% sure, and can only take that position on mostly faith.

What if all religions were mostly correct.  What if the true pathway to Heaven is to believe in One God at the top of our belief systems?  What if our individual chosen religions are good enough to get your ticket punched and the pearly gates opened?

Or what if we all got it wrong, and it's the Wiccans that are right.  MAN are we gonna be upset if we find out we should have joined Covens and gotten ready for our spirits to do their own thing after life ends.

2024-04-04 08:21:53,kxzfs6q,"My friend, it is clear to me that you are sincere in your faith. Thank you for confronting this topic with respect. I am grateful for this opportunity to talk with you. My response to the gentleman I was communicating with after this post you responded to may be of interest to you. Regardless, this is what I would like to say to you directly. 

Based on what I do know of your culture, you truly are some of the most devout, hard working and loyal people to follow any faith. Your dedication and sincerity is well known and such energy and precision is admirable. The fact that your people know of Jesus is amazing to me, however to believe that He is not the Son of God is like being robbed of the benefits that God intends to give people through Him. Being sinless and born of the Holy Spirit, Jesus died to save us all and make us royalty in God's sight. You and everyone else deserves to know that God has ordained you to be precious, royal children made in the image and accepted by the Most High. 

To respond to your highlights, 

1. I completely understand. This choice God made emphasizes how much God loves us all. Just as God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son, God Himself chose to sacrifice His Son for all of us to be saved. That's just how much He loves us - as His own children! 
2. I understand. Though America was founded on Judeo-Christian values, our government has been gaslighting and manipulating us to hate one another. Now our nation has followed the Satan worshipping elites that control America and played the harlot with God. I believe judgment is coming for this very reason.
3. I think 2 covers this point. However, to go into more detail, much like the gentleman I was discussing things with earlier in this line of comments, I want to respect and love all life as Jesus did. Unfortunately, certain sins have been used as a method to bring people away from God and accumulate consequences in their individual lives in the form of judgment. I don't want this for anyone. I fell into the same trap. I was in love with all of the lustful music that was praised so heavily in our country. I literally almost died as a direct result of my sins and if I didn't face this life or death judgment, I probably would have continued being a harlot until I was punished severely for what I was taught was admirable. 

I know you're not trying to be offensive, I can tell by how you're talking to me. You're right. God wants a perfect church and Jesus is coming back to rapture those who are clean and do their best to operate in holiness. Many things have attempted to water down our personal relationship with God, but ultimately, I know that God will help those who are sincere towards Him - even those who were heavily misled like myself. 

The same can be said of Jesus - thousands of years later, He's still changing lives today. We all have a personal relationship with God. Those who truly seek Him will be blessed to find the truth, I'm sure of it because He is so merciful and good. But many snares are laid by spiritual enemies that we should be careful to protect ourselves from. The God of the Bible prioritizes love and justice. His commandments are so holy that many (at least in America) don't want to follow Him because He's so pure. Not only does this God command what I personally find to be the most important values, but He saved my life when I needed Him. I fear Him. I worship only Him. He is worthy to be praised. So many times has He answered our calls. I'm grateful for Him and I want people to know that He is the God who saves. I don't deserve His help, it's who He is. If He's willing to help me, someone so foolish, He will help anyone if they just call on His name. 

Amen to the One who was and is and is to come. 

While I can't speak on everyone you named at the end of your message, and while I don't know very much about the Muslim faith, I do want to specify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God - not because I have any interest in disagreement or discomfort, but because it is only through Jesus that my mountains of sin have been removed and forgiven and now I can have peace with God. Nothing I can do will ever repay all that I've done wrong in the eyes of the Most High God. Jesus is the only reason I'm still here and the only reason I would ever be able to enter Heaven. 

I'm so far from perfect. If I said or did anything right in this message, may God be richly glorified, amen.",Practical_Today9849

On the most basic level, your argument is based on the ""fact"" that all of these observations are showing us something ""unusual,"" and thus somehow are indicating that there is some bad thing that's happening on this scale.

Of course, good or bad doesn't matter to the Universe.  It could be that tomorrow some pulse from a neutron star will pass through us and we'll all die...  the Universe won't care (and we will be dead, so neither will we).

But you are referencing observations about actions in the solar system over a timespan of at most a few centuries.  To call them unusual is to ASSUME that we know what the ""usual"" state of these bodies are, and have been, for literally billions of years.

In all of my years of practicing Christianity, I have not questioned my own faith.  However, I've also delved deeply into the fundamentals of the various organized incarnations of faith practice.  The Baptist vs. the Methodist vs. the Protestant vs. the Catholic vs. the 7th Day Adventists vs. the Mormons, etc.

And I have valid questions that remain unanswered.  Maybe you can help answer some of them for me, and help me better discourse my positions.

For example, why are there so many different sects of Christianity?  And so many interpretations of the Holy Bible?

Additionally, why did the Nicean Council tinker with the Bible over a period of several hundred years, and why did they choose only 4 Gospels of the Apostles in their presentation?  

Why would Catholics and Protestants come to killing each other in Ireland based on nuances in their beliefs?  Which side is God on regarding this issue, anyway?

When Cain and Abel left the Garden and later returned with wives, were those wives their sisters?  You can't take the Bible completely literally, there are metaphors, parables, analogies, stories, and lessons throughout.  What did Ezekiel see in the sky?  

And, why did Wernher Von Braun choose to only place Psalms 19:1 on his tombstone, and why are so many Christians so dismissive of a flat Earth type model?

We have to accept things on faith, I subscribe to that.  But, I also subscribe to the fact that every aspect of life, and all of the workings of the universe are not addressed in Biblical teachings (ie: the Periodic Table of Elements).

I have also been considering volunteering for internships on USA-affiliated organisations as I am well aware of how tough it is to immigrate there regarding VISA regulations. Unfortunately I have been exclusively getting denied due to not speaking the local language(which i am willing to learn), current geographical location or \[insert generic corporate responses\].

You’ve not really explained about what you have been doing back in Equatorial Guinea. How do you afford to eat/pay rent? Have you been working in anything? Have you tried volunteering there in Equatorial Guinea (so that you can practice any skills that you have)?

Ultimately what is it that you want to do with your career and life? You said you were chasing dreams before in university in the US, what were they? 

You can create an online business with the Estonian E-Residency service (https://www.e-resident.gov.ee/start-a-company/), however to get the paperwork you will need to do finger prints in a country that they provide the service. Perhaps Egypt or a country in Southern Europe would be best? Not sure. It also isn’t free, but isn’t an impossible amount of money. Could you also not just apply for a tax ID saying it is something physical that is being bought as well as the digital service? There must be something for “general consulting services” or something like that. 

All that being said, you can learn a lot online for free. It may not seem so but in 2 years time you can train up in most things in life. Your mission also does not need to be necessarily something that is A to B, from EQ to the US directly. Perhaps an A to B to C to D to E route in terms of location and jobs may need to occur. Maybe look for a job in STEM that is related to your degree, and is on the shortage job list for most countries where you could get a work visa. Train up in as much as you can in it online for free and volunteer time to work on projects pro bono to develop a portfolio, to then apply for a scholarship to a country to do a masters/other course. Then from there be able to look for a job in this field and get the work visa for a job there. This requires being anywhere from just good to being undeniable depending on the job you are applying for a work visa for. Then when you are settled elsewhere, you can work on changing careers to what you really want to do. 

It’s a bit chicken and the egg. You won’t get hired to work abroad, but you need to be in that country to be considered by employers, which requires a visa which requires a job offer. Finding another (legal) way to base yourself in that country is key. 

Speaking to alumni from your university. Perhaps even messaging someone from your old department and ask them for some guidance. I’m sure someone can help point you in the right direction of where and what to do next. However without a clear vision of what you want to do, that is very difficult.

Get at least some marketable skills, whatever they are, even as a cashier. Could you teach English? Teach fitness or yoga at some of the local hotels (once you get yourself back in shape)?

OK, your government doesn't provide you with a pathway for a tax id for your online business. I see two possibilities here: either (1) nobody in the entire Equatorial Guinea is providing any online services to anyone - which seems unlikely. Or, (2) you might be the first person in the entire Equatorial Guinea who offered to pay taxes from their online activities - which is more likely.

Most people in the world don’t even have the money to pay for just the flight to the US, the OP had the opportunity to study there and squandered that opportunity by studying exercise science, as if it would be fundamentally different than in their home country and lead to employment abroad.

Any parent who funded that study junket, who had to work hard for the money, would have made sure the OP studied something very specific and relevant to the world, in any country where they may find themselves.

It is clear from the OP’s post that she must be part of the political elite in Equatorial Guinea, or from a family that is connected, to have been able to study in the US and then on her return, to be fully supported by her family for 5 years, without even taking any job.

2024-04-03 21:45:35,kxx506o,"Post by Independent-Cat-2582 -- Hey y'all,  
Let me get right to it. Been feeling lost af in the job application vortex since the whole world went sideways. Here's me: West African immigrant, pushing 30, unemployed for nearly five years. Sigh, let me explain:  
Back to the States... Again & Uni Life (2013-2018)  
Returning to the U.S. wasn't new territory for me. I mean, I grew up there as a kid, so no culture shock there. But this time I'd be an F-1 International student at an established university in the Midwest. Looking back, a heads-up about the booming STEM fields would've been nice. But instead, I majored in Exercise Science with a minor in Graphic Design, thinking I was chasing dreams. (Joke was on me.)  
Internship Inferno (Summer 2018)  
Before graduating, bagged an internship at a fancy sports performance center of a  well-known brand  – sounded like a dream gig, right? Wrong. Cue microaggressions, profiling, and a whole lot of disillusionment. Turns out, the industry wasn't as forward-thinking as I'd hoped, especially for sports and conditioning. And the staff pages on many company websites? Let's just say diversity wasn't their strong suit.  
OPT Letdown & Back Home (Just in Time for the Apocalypse)  
Graduated, OPT unfortunately only landed me dead-end, part-time, minimun wage jobs. After a year of that hell experience my OPT and visa were up and I went back home. No prospective jobs or plan b. Took some time to reflect and plan my next move, the BAM!, The 2020 apocalypse, talk about adding insult to injury. Basically, nothing panned out as expected.  
Graphic Design Pivot, But Wait... There's a Catch (or Two)  
Tried to pivot to remote jobs and freelance graphic design, but with zero experience,  millennial recession and an immigrant passport turned out to be a pain. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr? Nope, my country's regulations make online work a no-go zone. Plus many first world clients wouldn't look my way when they have local professionals.  
Passport to Nowhere & Citizenship Struggles  
Turns out, having a passport from a third world, dictatorship country closes many doors and stunts many opportunities before I even get started!  This is because my country hasn't built relationships with many foreign ministries. I can't even create an online business,become a digital nomad, as registering for self-employment or having a tax ID for an online business is not allowed/doesn't exist - physical businesses only. I've confirmed this with tax professionals and several lawyers locally. As a result, citizens like myself often miss out on Volunteering, internships, apprenticeships etc., opportunities overseas, as my country bever qualifies.  It's frustrating – I have the skills and ambition, but my citizenship throws a huge wrench in the works.  
The Invisible Applicant & The Job Hunt Abyss  
Fast forward to today, and my graphic design dreams are collecting dust. Job hunting feels like being the bridesmaid but never the bride. I've been applying online and locally for years to no avail. My resume has a giant ""experience gap"" glaring at employers (5 years, no dice!).  
To summarize, the Roadblocks are stalked:  
Huge resume gap with no experience  
Useless degree, so it seems  
Citizenship and passport limitations  
Broke AF - no access to re-enrolling in school, a laptop or design softwares to practice/improve skills  
Millennial recession, sigh  
But There's Still a Light at the End of the Tunnel (I Hope!)  
I'm a fast learner and open to exploring other fields. Definitely not limiting myself with on fitness or graphic design. For instance, I've been into Marketing (SEO, Social Media marketing etc) Writing and AI (designing and prompting) these past few years.  
This  the part where I need guidance, if you could do me a solid:  
Anyone whose navigated the tricky waters of unemployment, visa limitations, and a career change? Hit me up!  If you've discovered the Krabby Patty Secret Formula please I'm desperado, any advice, leads, or even a pep talk would be a lifesaver.  
Can I leverage my “Americanized” experience and education to get visa sponsorship jobs (longshot, i know) literally anywhere abroad?  
Any website or companies I can apply to increase my chances?  
Are there other platforms I can network?  
Thanks for listening!

2024-04-04 16:59:58,ky1drbh,"From your other posts I can see that you are not setting yourself low enough targets for jobs. 

I don’t mean this in a mean way. I have been there myself. 

You should allow yourself to work any job. Supermarket, English tutor, cafe worker. Can’t get the front of house job at a cafe? Did you ask them can you work back or house? Can’t get that? Did you ask them if they need a cleaner before or after? Can’t get that? Do they know another cafe who needs someone? 

In your case, can you do graphic design, for free, for something within sports? E.g. a local sports club? Who would say no to that? 

It might be a bit Jordan Peterson-esque, but allowing yourself to win small enough wins and progressing from the lowest targets is key. E.g. for the problems with fitness, instead of trying to be in the gym everyday day/other day, how about just making sure everyday you do 5 press ups. Just 5. Then after a week/when it gets too easy, make it 6. Etc. progressive overload. 

Over time you will be better. But aiming low enough is key. The ultimate low target is to just try to make your own bed in the morning. Every morning. It will start your day with a sense of achievement. Silly but every little helps when you are very depressed and long term unemployed. 

Good luck with it all, but do try to stop the “woe is me attitude” as well. You have a lot going for you, but only you can help you. We see people on this subreddit who are in much much worse situations than you, for example someone who somehow manages to carve out 30 mins of paid coding work on a library computer on their walk from being abused in school to being abused at home where they have no access to laptop/internet. This isn’t to make you feel bad but it is for you to gain perspective. Rise to it.",Jean_Stockton
2024-04-04 17:39:39,ky1l236,"OK, so having connections helps with getting a job. It's actually the case pretty much anywhere.

The way you obtain connections is by helping people. You teach some kids English or fitness - doesn't have to be at a government school, you can do it privately. These kids have friends. Their friends have parents. These parents personally know a CEO. Then they tell the CEO about a wonderful hard-working lady who's helping the local kids. 

Right now, even if you did have connections, what are they going to tell the CEO? ""Hey, I know this lady who hasn't had a job for 5 years, and still doesn't want to work at your supermarket, can you imagine?"" Connections right now would likely hurt your case, not help.",MonadTran

2024-04-04 18:14:53,ky1rkdp,"Thank you for your insights!   I'm not taking it to heart at all. I actually agree with most things you're saying... From a first world perspective (the privilege of having endless opportunities).    


 That being said, I have no access to laptop. I have no money. I'm not tryna pity myself but this is my life. My biggest blessing is having a family to sustain me for food and shelter. Otherwise id be in the streets.     


 The problem, even with your examples are very westernized. Library? Gym? movie theather?  Doesn't exist in many third world countries, these are privileges. Once you see it from that perspective i think you'd understand better.    


 Despite my hustle mentality, finding opportunities in fields like fitness and graphic design is tough due to limited/nonexistent demand and heavyyy reliance on word of mouth. These aren't necessities.  


 I've applied for jobs like PE teacher,  administrative assistant, secretary, embassy roles, and even supermarket positions locally. Job portals are ghost portals, all or most are internal hiring, and connections-based hiring practices. (Connections over skills and qualifications).   


Most importantly, the country is small, Small population, smaller job opportunities.  


   I've bonded with many immigrants about this, India, Thailand, Philippines etc about these constraints. Every country is different though.  


  I'm here for constructive criticisms and new ideas, as I've exhausted many avenues without success.

2024-04-04 18:52:28,ky1ylgv,"Let me give you an a hypothetical example -  Democrats vs Republicans: 


 In this world Democrats offer the (best) jobs and if you're a Democrat, you will have a job and if you're Republican, you will not.  


 In this world (my country) the Democrats reign, 50+ years strong. Democrats have all the jobs from office, schools, best local business and supermarkets etc.  


 The only way to get employed, is to have a connection through a Democrat, if you don't have one, you're off to just being a ""republican"" - housekeeping, labor jobs, selling second hand clothing at the market etc.


  There's another group though , the ""independents"" where they have found success in having their own private businesses. No always make the most money but they're getting by just fine. This is what you're suggesting.  


 So Yes, ""connections"".  


 Again this is all hypothetical I'm not getting into any party disputes, I'm just giving you an example _________________________________

I'm not being facetious. I'm trying to point out that there is a very distinct legal difference between being denied boarding on a plane and being denied entry into the country. You can have one without the other.

It's completely OK for the government to require airlines to only allow vaccinated people to board. An unvaccinated person on an airplane during COVID is a major health risk to everyone else on board. It's a completely sensible rule. You are not entitled to board the plane of a private business that has other people on it. The airline has the full right to deny you if you don't follow their rules, be that vaccination or baggage requirements. 

You are, however, entitled entry into Canada. But it's not the government's job to bring you to the border. Just like if you went to a foreign country, ran out of money, and couldn't afford a plane ticket back. That's not the government's responsibility. It's on you to make sure you can get back, whether that involves buying a plane ticket, charting a private jet, or getting vaccinated so you can board a plane.",broyoyoyoyo

EU citizens have a right to live and work in all member states so they aren't comparable to for example Mexicans in the US.

Finally there are certain laws that grant a ""right to return"" to people whose ancestors had been German before WWII and those don't really count as immigrants in some statistics.

She invited German farmers to move to Russia and gave them free land because she saw that the Russians had shitty farming practices and figured they could learn something.

Travel insurance documents.
Etsa or visa.
Copy of your passport.
Copy of your birth certificate.
Any hotel reservations you have prior to staying with friends.

Most of all your itinerary with all your flights and your return flight ticket back to your country.

It's a little over board but it shows your intent of a holiday and that's only if you are taken into secondary inspection which is rare unless they suspect you.

You still need to show PKR 50 lacs if you’re going for a free university though. 

It is almost impossible to get a job in western countries though. Relatively easier for Gulf, and its not true that they pay you less if youre not a gora. If you have the relevant experience and education, they pay you better than what you’ll get anywhere else in the world especially Saudi Arabia and Dubai.

This can vary per country (Most countries have a website where they discuss the finer details so you can research), but generally that means at minimum a Bachelor's degree in an in-demand STEM or healthcare field. Coding, engineering, etc. are often the big ones. 

Unfortunately, despite the shit folks get, Trans folks don't qualify for refugee status from the US, so you still would need to meet that criteria, which with just a HS education means your options are little-to-none. If this is something you're really set on doing, I would say to start with making sure you're in a relatively safe state (Good call getting to NY from Arizona), and look into getting an education in one of those fields. If you don't have the means, then your best bet would be to look at working for a big company that offers free/reduced college as a perk, such as Target, Hilton, Pepsi, Tyson or many big hospital systems.",ExceedinglyGayKodiak

I’m saying this as the foreign national (in this context) who married an American here. We’ve known each other for six years, our relationship accelerated over last two, now we are wearing matching rings as of Leap Day.

The paperwork we need to produce is kinda ridiculous. Proof of travel to each other and together. Photos. Chat records. Wedding photos. Police certificates (FBI NOLO letter).

Leaving the US is extremely hard and not that realistic without a college degree in a very important field (science, medicine, law, teaching, etc. ) (It also costs a ton of money to make the move, and unless you marry someone from that country, you'll need to get a work visa which is very hard to do.)

San Francisco is the most lgbt friendly city in the US, and California is the safest state for LGBT people. (Hawaii is also very safe and it's rarely ever cold there, so that's an option.) I have never experienced any hate while living here in the SF Bay Area, so I know you'll have a much better and safer life here, or moving to Las Angeles or San Diego. Trust me on this when I say San Francisco, California is so safe I almost forget my friends in other US states have to hide their pride pins when walking to and from school. (I'm just so used to the culture in SF that I forget I'm just hella lucky and not everyone in the US has this amount of safety.)

If you really do feel the need to leave the US, and snow is a big issue for you, most of Europe is out of the question. The majority of Africa is unsafe for trans people, aside from South Africa, so you may want to avoid moving there. Israel is pretty safe for trans people, but they aren't safe in terms of constant bombs and violent neighboring countries, and moving there as a non-jew is hard. Australia is always an option, although it's really hard to move all the way there, it does snow and is home to the most venomous animals out of any continent. New Zealand is also a very safe option, but they also snow in the winter, so honestly I'd just stay in the US because as long as you live in a very liberal state you'll be okay.",Comprehensive_Fox_79

While the ceremony itself is performed in India as well, it looks like Texas State has laws against using hot tools such as the one used here. The article mentions that the kid wasn't aware of exactly what would be used.

Perhaps the temple Trust (which administered the ceremony) wasn't aware of the local laws either. Also, it's weird why 12 year old kids are allowed to undergo this ceremony. The ceremony signifies accepting Vishnu as the true God and taking a vow to abide by the Vaishnava philosophy. It makes no sense to include kids here as they're too young to understand any of this.

The allegation that you didn't know what was happening is ridiculous. Before the ceremony starts the ""Acharya"" explains the steps and procedures.

Poor victims don't get to be the center, their identities do.

 In india the practice of piercing baby's ears is extremely normalised and common if you say let the kid grow decide for themselves they'll look at you with such disappointment like ""how dare you question our practices "" but why on the kid though. Altering a child's body when they are unaware of it is just child abuse but this concept people can't comprehend in their minds. 

Eventually many girls also have to get their nose pierced.

Some Indian tribes like to tattoo their children with symbols and say it's for better immunity.  Somebody needs to freaking educate these people that babies need nothing but care and fresh breast milk 🤣. 

There's another normalized practice of making cuts on babies head with a blade during muhorram which is again crazy... they like defend saying the blade is clean and cuts are very little but why do you want make the cuts to begin with 😅 bachha kayko matam manaega he can't even speak yet.",Owlet08
