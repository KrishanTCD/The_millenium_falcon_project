2.2. Cleaning Script
Your cleaning script will:

Remove stopwords using NLTK.
Remove low-frequency words to reduce the dimensionality of your dataset.
Detect and remove comments in languages other than English using langdetect.
Remove emojis using the emoji library.

The analysis will involve several steps:

Word Distribution: Use matplotlib to visualize the frequency distribution of words.
Sentiment Analysis: textblob can be used to determine the sentiment of comments.
TF-IDF and Term Frequency: Utilize scikit-learn for TF-IDF and term frequency vector models.
LDA Topic Modeling: Use gensim for LDA modeling to identify topics within the data related to immigration in the USA.

Implementing this from start to finish would require writing Python scripts for each step mentioned. For brevity, I'll provide a high-level overview of how one might structure the scripts for each phase:

Data Collection Script (with PRAW): Authenticate with Reddit's API using PRAW, fetch posts and comments based on keywords related to immigration, and save the relevant data (username, comment, upvotes) to a CSV file.
Data Cleaning Script: Read the CSV file, filter out comments with emojis or non-English languages, remove stopwords and low-frequency words.
Analysis Script: With the cleaned data, conduct the various analyses (word distribution, sentiment analysis, TF-IDF, LDA) using the libraries mentioned, and visualize the results or output them as needed.

For each of these steps, especially steps 2 and 3, you'd write detailed Python code to implement the specific functionalities. Given the complex nature of this project, focusing on one step at a time and testing thoroughly at each stage would be crucial for success.

Each of these code snippets provides a starting point for the respective step in your project. Due to the complexities of natural language processing and the limits of this format, each snippet is fairly basic. You may need to refine and expand upon them based on your specific requirements, the intricacies of your dataset, and the depth of analysis you wish to achieve.
