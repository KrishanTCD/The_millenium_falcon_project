2024-04-11 15:29:44,Is this possible - need help on map visual,1,1c1hyuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerBI/comments/1c1hyuz/is_this_possible_need_help_on_map_visual/,0,1712849384.0,"Hi everyone,

I have two tables:

Table 1: A list of all jobs and their locations (UK Postcodes). Table 2: A list of my consultants and their home addresses (UK Postcodes).

I've already created two map visuals. The visual on the left is made from Table 1, and the visual on the right is from Table 2. It's a report for operations management to assess whether we have enough cover for upcoming jobs next year or if we need to hire more consultants in certain areas with high demand for upcoming jobs.

[current 2 visuals](https://preview.redd.it/160q4g1ibvtc1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbb0a061b2680ace0c2be9bdf970228154f55cf0)

 What I want to do is be able to click on a job on the left visual (Table 1) and then filter the right visual (Table 2) to show all consultants within a 100-mile radius. How do I achieve this?

I hope I've explained the problem clearly. If not, please feel free to ask any questions, and I would appreciate any feedback or help in the right direction.

I get not talking to the police in case you say something incriminating but to refuse to answer basic questions like ""do you understand?"" and ""are you ok?"" was very weird.

I originally took it to be Ruby taking Jodi/lawyers advice to the extreme however when watching a video on YouTube (for the life of me I cannot remember which one - there have been so many) that went into the timeline of what happened and where everyone was, something struck me. The video included all the 911 operators calls and how she coordinated it all. When they worked out who R's mother was, they said the only thing they had on file for her was a driving offense recently.

Whoever did the video then included the bodycam footage of that traffic stop and Ruby behaves in a similar way, barely speaking actually barely looking at the officer. 

Anyone shed any light on this behaviour? Or is this normal for people to behave in the US towards police officers? (I'm UK based)

Currently 19 and live in the UK but I have dual citizenship with lots of family across many states in the US I could live with temporarily while I got on my feet. 

But overall, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd assume the work is similar / the same and pays relatively similar. I'd also really appreciate some insight on positives and negatives of this trade in the US as where I am in the UK it has felt like 70% of the day is spent in the van between jobs in traffic especially on maintenance & repair side of things, which is something I wouldn't miss if it's any different in the US. 

I would appreciate any advice on what to do and anything I should avoid taking this career path. Thanks :)"

2024-04-11 15:25:30,Rebooking Drew McIntyre's WWE Championship Reigns (Part 3:Second Reign),1,1c1hv8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybooking/comments/1c1hv8h/rebooking_drew_mcintyres_wwe_championship_reigns/,0,1712849130.0,"After his victory against AJ Styles at Wrestlemania 37, Drew McIntyre looks to move on from his feuds with established stars, looking to showcase rising talent in his reign. However, his first challenge is from a former WWE Champion, Sheamus, who doesn't win the United States Championship in this universe. After winning the Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal at Wrestlemania, Sheamus wins a fatal four-way also involving Bobby Lashley, Braun Strowman and The Miz. Instead of getting too directly involved with McIntyre, Sheamus focuses on winning matches and proving himself as a viable challenger. During these matches, McIntyre seems to be scouting Sheamus, going on commentary and watching at ringside. At Backlash, the two men beat the piss out of each other. At one point, Drew McIntyre breaks Sheamus' nose with an elbow. The ending comes when the champion reverses White Noise into a Future Shock, and hits a Claymore for the victory.

In between Backlash and Hell In A Cell, Drew McIntyre has 2 championship defenses in NXT and NXT UK, against Tommaso Ciampa and Ilja Dragunov, further cementing his intent on showing off younger stars. He obviously retains both times, yet comes very close to losing both times. Ciampa gets a near-fall with an Air Raid Siren off the top rope, while Dragunov gets a near fall with a H-Bomb and the Torpedo Moscow.

On Raw, Drew McIntyre has begun a feud with Aleister Black, who has been undefeated since turning heel in November. He beats Kevin Owens in a #1 contenders match, and plays mind games with McIntyre in the build, even threatening his family. At Hell In A Cell, it is again a match where both men beat the piss out of each other. Both men are continuing to brawl, when Black goes for the Black Mass, which McIntyre ducks and hits the Claymore. The champion goes for the cover and Black somehow kicks out. The challenger gets on his knees, wanting McIntyre to hit another Claymore. He does it, goes for the cover, and wins. 

Going into Money In The Bank, McIntyre returns to his feud with The Club, now with Finn Balor who has returned from NXT. Despite this, Kevin Owens becomes #1 contender for the WWE Championship by defeating Styles clean, planting the seeds for The Club's break-up. In the build, Owens and McIntyre have to form an uneasy alliance to battle The Club, who keep meddling in their affairs. At Money In The Bank, The Club continue to get involved, at one point inadvertantly helping Kevin Owens stay in the match by putting his foot on the rope after the champion goes for the cover after a Claymore. Towards the end of the match, The Club attempt to get involved physically, yet Owens and McIntyre fight them off. When they finally clear them, the challenger goes for the Stunner when the champion's back is turned, yet McIntyre pushes him off and hits a Claymore for the victory. After the match, The Club attack both men, and Finn Balor holds up the WWE Championship, with AJ Styles looking on in envy.

Towards Summerslam, Drew McIntyre is caught up in the ongoing civil war within The Club. A 16-man #1 contenders tournament is made for the night after Money In The Bank to determine the WWE Championship challenger. AJ Styles beats Bobby Lashley and Finn Balor beats Kofi Kingston to make a Club final. In the final, Luke Gallows immediately punch both men at the same time, leading to a no-contest. After the match, Finn Balor states that it was their plan all along to get to the final and make it a no-contest, leading to a triple threat match being made for Summerslam. The following week on Raw, Drew McIntyre defeats AJ Styles in a rematch from Wrestlemania after Finn Balor accidentally costs his friend the match. Finn Balor attempts to help Styles up after the match, yet is shoved to the ground. The following week, Finn Balor defeats Drew McIntyre. On the go-home show, Balor and Styles, who are still not on great terms, battle against Drew McIntyre and a mystery partner. This mystery partner turns out to be Jinder Mahal, partly reuniting 3MB. McIntyre and Mahal win after Finn Balor accidentally hits Styles with a Shotgun Dropkick, leading to McIntyre hitting Styles with a Claymore to pin him and get the win. At Summerslam, Balor and Styles attempt to get along and take out McIntyre, and it works originally when they put him through the announce table with a Phenomenal Forearm. Inevitably however, it falls apart, and the men battle it out for 10 minutes. After a Double Clothesline, both men are down, and McIntyre regains the advantage. He is about to win the match with a Claymore, yet Gallows and Anderson come out and attack the champion. Styles and Balor join in, and after a 1916 on a chair, McIntyre is rendered out of the match completely. After this, it looks like the two challengers are going to be able to finish their battle. However, Gallows, Anderson and Balor turn to Styles, and beat the shit out of him. Gallows and Anderson hit the Magic Killer, and Balor hits two Coup De Grace's to win the match and the WWE Championship, turning on his best friend."

So far I've:
- washed the plant in the shower with plain water (preserving the soil because I don't have any to replace it with)
- I trimmed away (or pulled out) the brown crunchy dried leaves and stems
- with advice I made a dish soap, isopropyl alcohol and water mix in a spray bottle that I doused my plant with for a few days then did it less regularly like once a week ish because I was scared
- recently I put dish soap on a tissue and gave the leaves wipe to remove the white flakes I found on the leaves and the grown brown scales on others

When I got the plant, after trimming the green leaves were almost fully green but some of the tips of the leaves had browned and dried out. I'm noticing now that some of the previously fully green leaves are losing their green pigment and turning brown throughout. In fact, I'm noticing one of the new leaves that hasn't fully unfurled is turning brown too which is why I'm scared.

This is my first plant and I don't know what to do. I'm based in the UK for reference - I'd love some help on what this looks like to you and if you think I can save it please 🙏🏼 I'm hoping there's an ""easy"" way to save it.

Thank you xo
PS: there's one weird bunched up leaf in the last picture. It's been a few weeks and it hasn't opened up like some of the other new leaves. I'm thinking to cut it off? Thoughts?"
2024-04-11 15:24:41,Wake-On-Lan your SteamDeck: a full guide and caveats,1,1c1hujf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1c1hujf/wakeonlan_your_steamdeck_a_full_guide_and_caveats/,0,1712849081.0,"Recently I have been trying to get wake-on-lan (WOL) working on my LCD steamdeck with JSAUX dock. There has been many issues I have encountered, so I decided to summarize here so others can benefit.

**Why:**
* I want to play my steam library on my phone through steam link.


**Limitations:**

* You need a dock with Ethernet capability. Mine is [JSAUX 6-in-1 docking station](https://jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck).
* Easier to work with local network. If you want to do WOL over the internet, you need to setup port forwarding yourself, or configure a VPN (such as tailscale) to redirect your connection to one of your active computer/server in your home
* Steam is not officially supporting this feature. So it might break on future update.
* Do it at your own risk. Although everything I do is relatively safe, do not run commands from internet if you dont know what it will does to your system. 

&#x200B;

**How to:**

1. Unlock the readonly mode and make a sudo account. Please refer to other guides to do so. To confirm, try to install the packages we will need for checking later.

&#8203;

    $ sudo pacman -S gnu-netcat 

2. Get the ethernet *interface,* IP address, *MAC address,* and *broadcast address.* In the example below, *enp4s0f3u1u4* is the interface, and 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx is my MAC address, 163.xxx.xxx.xx is my IP address, and 163.xxx.xxx.255 is my broadcast address

&#8203;

    $ ip a
    5: enp4sxxxxxx: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 163.xxx.xxx.xx/xx brd 163.xxx.xxx.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp4s0f3u1u4

3. Enable the WOL feature of your network card. After querying ethtool interface, if Wake-on is ""d"", it means the feature is currently disabled. Then you need to set the value to ""g"". To make the changes persistent, please refer to the [archwiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wake-on-LAN).

&#8203;

    $ sudo ethtool enp4sxxxxxx | grep Wake-on
    
    Supports Wake-on: pumbag
    Wake-on: d
    
    $ sudo ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g

4. For the purpose of debugging, you can stop the firewall. It is not necessary for the WOL to works though. 

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl stop firewalld

5. Install a wake-on-lan application on your mobile phone, such as [this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.mrwebb.wakeonlan&hl=en&gl=US). Configure the MAC address, broadcast address, and IP address appropriately, and set WOL port to 9.
6. On your steamdeck, make sure firewall is disabled, and try to run the following command. While the command is running, try to press the send the WOL magic packet from your phone. If it works properly, then you will see some output on your steamdeck.

&#8203;

    $ sudo nc --udp --listen --local-port=9 --hexdump
    
    �������Lh��Lh��Lh��Lh����Lh��Lh�.... Received 102 bytes from the socket
    00000000  FF FF FF FF  FF FF 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  ........Lh....Lh
    00000010  17 E3 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  17 E3 00 E0  ....Lh....Lh....
    ...

7. If the previous part is working, congratulation, you can try to sleep your steamdeck and send the magic package from your phone to wake it up. Now you can reenable your firewall

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld

8. But, you might notice that, after the deck is sleeping for >15s, it will no longer wake up the deck. It leads to the second part to modify the ethernet power management. 
9. First, we need to find the appropriate usb devices for our ethernet. To do so, run lsusb. Try to list down all the ID for the Ethernet adapter, in my case, it's all the devices that starts with Realtek semiconductor, i.e. ""0bda:8153"", ""0bda:0411"", ""0bda:5411""

&#8203;

    $ sudo lsusb
    
    Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 003 Device 003: ID 13d3:3553 IMC Networks Bluetooth Radio
    Bus 003 Device 002: ID 28de:1205 Valve Software Steam Controller
    Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 0bda:8153 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8153 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter
    Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0bda:0411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. Hub
    Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 001 Device 004: ID 3434:0311 Keychron Keychron V1
    Bus 001 Device 003: ID 17ef:60e4 Lenovo Lenovo Legion M300 RGB Gaming Mouse
    Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0bda:5411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTS5411 Hub
    Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

10. The previous ID format is given as ""idVendor:idProduct"". We now need to find the appropriate driver for the those three usb devices. Run the following two commands, and pinpoint which usb devices corresponds to the IDs. 

&#8203;

    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idVendor
    ...
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/idVendor <==
    0bda
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/idVendor <==
    0bda
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/idVendor <==
    0bda
    ...
    
    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idProduct
    ...
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/idProduct <==
    5411
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/idProduct <==
    8153
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/idProduct <==
    0411
    ,,,
    

1. Check and enable the power management for these devices.  

&#8203;

    ## change the paths appropriately
    
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup
    disabled
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup
    enabled
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup
    disabled
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup""
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup""
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup""

11. Test to see if the WOL is working fine now. 
12. If it's working fine, you can make the changes persistent by writing a systemd service, as follows. Also after testing, turns out I dont need to enable ""1-1"" to make WOL work reliably.

&#8203;

    /etc/systemd/system/wol.service
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    [Unit]
    Description=Enable WOL usb
    Wants=network-pre.target
    After=network-pre.target NetworkManager.service
    
    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g ; sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup"" ; sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup""
    Restart=on-failure
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

13. Also, enable the unit.

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl enable wol.service

14. Profit! Enjoy your game by streaming to your deck from your mobile phone through Steam Link.

&#x200B;

**Caveats and TODOs:**

1. Only deck built in screen is turned on when turning on through WOL. If you have any suggestion how to turn on both displays, please let me know.
2. Haven't fully tested the systemd service yet."
2024-04-11 15:24:11,Ungrateful but I feel guilty if I stop doing what I should,1,1c1hu6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1c1hu6c/ungrateful_but_i_feel_guilty_if_i_stop_doing_what/,0,1712849051.0,"I have a narcissistic mom in her early 60's and I'm the youngest between me and my sister who is over a decade older than me.(30F,40F). From I've been 14 I've been helping with my mom's healthcare because she is diabetic etc. In my 20's I would be there mostly as her caregiver in the hospital and at home, sometimes financially when we would have to go to the hospital for an emergency and be there as emotional support.

Idk what but the caring mother I knew changed into a manipulative narcissistic character.

I'd realize growing up I would be labelled as the black sheep even though I always assisted heavily around the house everyday, followed rules but had my own bit of individuality I would be passionate about(piercings) but I always did well in school. I went through a traumatic situation that affected my university years and she would throw it in my face and call me mad(mentally unstable) even when she knows I am telling the truth. 

One time I told her something that another family member said about her and to get out of it, the person lied and tried to accuse me of making it up or being mad. My mother also berated me with those insults and say I must be mad. Later on, she found information confirming that I was telling the truth and never apologized. 

She also has a friend from the UK she knows from her childhood that she only talks about my older sister with and her kids. She never mentions any updates about me or good things with me.

We live in a family home(30F) with other family members but I take care of her daily. In our neighbourhood when we have an argument she would be on the top of her lungs calling me mental and making it seem to others as if I suffer from mental health issues. Quite a few people in the neighbourhood know me and she has no qualms embarassing me. In the country I live there are severe negative connotations and stigma associated with mental health issues and alot of people who suffer from this disease are met with violence.

At this point, this is one of the things she constantly says on the top of her voice. Living in a neighbourhood where people can easily hear this and spread gossip, I believe she chooses to do this to me because no matter what I always come back and help her and speak to her. Whereby with my older sister, she couldnt do or say half of these things to her without significant repercussions or my sister deciding to not speak with her again or allow her to see her children. 

I hate toxicity and even though I have my flaws I hate that I have to be consistently berated, attacked and embarassed but feel guilty if I put my foot down and stop caring for her. I dont deserve this treatment and its crazy because everybody else sees her as a nice sweetheart but she has some terrible narcissistic traits that are hurtful. 

She throws rocks and hides her hands and no matter what I do for her, sacrifice for her... its never enough.

I put studying last, classes, things I have to do JUST so I can be able to care for her and give her the things she needs to be comfortable. I put myself 2nd or last but I seem to be the most hated.

I even get blamed for situations where I am the victim and didnt do anything to deserve it. 

So my question is, should I just move out and cut all ties or stay a little longer(by the end of the year) and let them know I will be moving out by then so they can arrange other plans?

My mental health is declining because of how I am being treated and I cannot continue to allow this anymore. I am deeply hurt and keep getting hurt in every corner of my life.

I left out alot of details but I have always been there with my mother through thick and thin and even though my older sister is in a better financial position than I at the moment I always try to do the best that I can.

I hope someone understands me at the very least. I'm not putting myself as this woe is me character ...I dont have any issues having my mother as the biggest priority in my life but shes very disrespectful and hurtful too many times and I dont think I can continue to take it.

I bought an unused tube of Melamet off Vinted and I started using it (just on the upper lip area) last year. I probably only used it consistently for 2 weeks in the evening, and I was really careful in the sunlight afterward (factor 50!) It faded this winter (I’m UK-based) but then I started using Glycolic Acid toner consistently to help with my hormonal acne. Whilst it helped a lot with the acne, it’s now made my hyperpigmentation worse! I’ve been reading all the risks about hydroquinone and I don’t want to use it again I( was stupid for even using it in the first place).

Do you think I’ve done any damage by using it for that brief period, and what safe alternatives are there to help minimise fade the tan-mustache?! "

I'm willing to drive up to 1.5 hrs for the right club.

What I'm looking for. A diverse, active and friendly club with keelboat sailing for me, and (eventually) dinghy instruction for my infant.

All the clubs I've found so far are either barely active, disorganised, on bits of the Hudson that don't look particularly fun to sail on or essentially social clubs.

The biggest in the area seems Nyack. But any others I should check out?

Happy to do river, lake or sea sailing.

Myself and my partner are preparing our application for an Unmarried Partner Family Visa - and were hoping to get some advice from the community at large - after a vary underwhelming encounter with an immigration firm we were hoping to use - who doesn't seem to be up on the latest UKVI changes etc.   


I am originally from the US and have been in the UK for 3 years as of next week, on a student visa which expires in early May. My partner is a British citizen, and we have been together in a relationship for 2 years 1 month, and living together for 2 years.   


We have lived together at 2 different addresses within the UK and have an array of documents to prove this in each of our names, as well as joint documents.   


We also have some photos and letters of support from UK family and friends regarding our relationship - so I am not concerned about the relationship or cohabitation aspects of the application.   


The reason we have been seeking out professional advice in the first place, was that my partner was let go from his employer in Feb 2024, just as we were gearing up to start our application. He had been with that employer for nearly 2 years, making £75k and we have all of those payslips + bank statements.  


He found a new job shortly after being let go, at the same salary - but his start date at the new job is not until the 29th of April. We have the settlement agreement from the old employer, the offer letter from the new employer etc as well.   


My partner also receives PIP so this makes us exempt from meeting the standard requirement, and needing to show adequate maintenance instead.   


As far as I know, you can combine PIP + income to show this - and when combined with his salary in relation to our housing costs (rent and council tax) we more than meet adequate maintenance   


But I am not sure if or how the slight ""gap"" in payslips will impact us - or if it will, given we had ""income"" from the settlement agreement from the old employer and there is a new job offer on the table at the same salary level.   


I am not sure how to frame this in a cover letter, or what/how much financial documents to show - and after speaking to the basically useless immigration firm - I am now confused as to whether we can apply now - or need to wait for him to actually ""start"" the new job.   


 I have finished my degree and have the right to work full time on my current visa until it expires, as a student who has finished their degree - and I also have an offer letter for a job which I start soon and which will provide an additional amount of salary - if that is useful as well.   


At this point, other than knowing which financial documents to send, if we are still able to - as well as how or if this gap will impact us - I would rather handle this myself if at all possible - as all other aspects of the application are straight forward, and I like to be in control of matters like tis as well as aware of all correspondence - as opposed to letting someone who may do a bad job - try to do it for me.   


I would really appreciate any help or advice. Thanks so much!

The team also investigated whether flat-faced ‘brachycephalic’ breeds were associated with higher risk. Surprisingly, longer-nosed ‘dolichocephalic’ breeds showed four times the odds of sedative/anaesthetic-related death compared with medium-length nose dogs, whereas no additional risk was seen in flat-faced breeds.

They are somewhat collectible to me, but really don't have monetary value. The declared value on this package was £50. I am certain I saw this on the outside of the package when I received it and the shipper is confident that's what he notated as well. Fast forward a couple of weeks and I have now been sent a UPS bill for $416.97.

This, of course, is absolutely nuts. So I called the Customs Broker phone line, and they told me the declared value was showing as $2550. This makes no sense to me. I saw there is a dispute button, but I threw away the packaging weeks ago, so I really have no evidence to prove my case. Is there anyone specific I should contact or anything to do to prove this wrong or bring up in a dispute? It will only let me type 80 characters, which isn't even enough for a full sentence."

I am a beginner tinwhistle player but advanced enough so that I started feeling limitations of the cheapest whistles: I've got a Feadog in D but the higher half of the higher octave is so unreliable and poor (too airy) sounding that it often limits me in playing.
I've found a guy who has four used whistles to sell, all in nice condition and reasonable prices. All in D so I am trying to convince myself there is no reason (other than GAS) to buy more than one. Maybe two if there is a reasonable explanation (like totally different sound or something).  
The four models I am choosing between are:
- Tony Dixon DX004   (https://www.tonydixonmusic.co.uk/product/soprano-whistle-key-of-d-4/)  
- Tony Dixon DX204D   (https://reverb.com/uk/item/12021977-dixon-solid-brass-d-whistle-dx204d)  
- Killarney Nickel   (https://mcneelamusic.com/wind/killarney-nickel-d-whistle/)  
- Goldfinch   (https://goldfinch.eu/pl/whistles/flazolet-high-d-goldfinch/)  
  
Which one (or maybe more than one?) should I choose and why?  
What is important to me? Ease of playing as I am still on my learning curve. ;)  
I've looked for reviews and sound samples online but this didn't solve my problem: I like the sound of every one of them (and it's really hard to tell the true sound from YT videos) and I haven't found any obvious reason to choose one over other ones.  
Please help me, share your recommendations, things I should know or anything that can help me choose. ;)   
And please, don't tell me ""buy them all"". I am trying to fight GAS, not feed it!  
Thanks!"

The thing is, this started around July 2023, progressively getting worse. I'm constantly battling fatigue, headaches, slight blurry vision in my right eye, and get more pins & needles in my arms and legs than I used to. I drink plenty of water during the day, I hit enough calories but still this is happening. 

What concerns me is that I can't check for swollen lymph nodes in my arm pits, as I had chest masculinisation surgery in 2021 and have no feeling in my chest/armpit area at all. 

Before all this started, I had a lot of energy but now I struggle to do anything but sleep.

I've been on testosterone injections (prescribed) since the start of 2023, and get injected every 10 weeks by my doctor.

Thank you to all who have participated in the survey so far, your input has been a great help. Just doing a 2nd wave of promotion for the study to try an increase the sample size.

I'm a final year undergraduate student on a live production based course. I am conducting a study as part of my dissertation which is aimed towards live sound engineers and touches on the topic of sound restrictions.

If you would like to participate in the study please use the following link:

https://linktr.ee/jakedaysound

The aim is to identify some of the most influential effects that sound restrictions have on the performance of live sound engineers, both positive and negative, as well as get broad feedback on how engineers can work more effectively under said restrictions.

I am very thankful to anybody who participates in the study and would like you all to know that this would help me out a great deal.

If you have any questions about the study I will be happy to answer them at the following email address: jd1741@my.acm.ac.uk

Huel seems fantastic to me because in my case the convenience is undeniably very helpful. Plus ADHD is the worst thing ever for meal planning and I like to be able to scale up/down my meals.

Huel is marketed as a meal replacement and a lot of people for drawn to it for losing weight. But in my case I need to gain a bit or maintain and I'm trying to hit the NHS 2500 calorie recommendation as that is roughly close to my baseline. The obvious solution is ""scoop more you idiot"" but the costs do seem to rise quite quickly. I might be wrong though as I am very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel.

Generally I make my own overnight oats and have them in the morning for breakfast plus a banana and tea which is about 547 kcal. Then lets have a hot & savory meal at lunch for 400 kcal, and then a hot and savory meal for dinner for another 400 kcal. I'll add on 120 kcal extra for the odd snack/tea. This totals at 1467 kcal so we're still 1033 kcal short of 2500. For those meals I'd need about 9 bags and it will cost around £167.40 (£2.65/meal) or £150.66 with student/NHS discount (£2.39/meal)

Some people have suggested using 3 scoops so we'll try that as well. 547 kcal for breakfast, 600 Huel H&S (Lunch), 600 Huel H&S (Dinner), and after adding on 120 kcal you get 1867 so still 633 kcal short of 2500. Going by my bad maths I'd need about 13 bags of Huel H&S at £223.20 (£3.98/meal) or £217.62 with student/NHS discount (£3.58/meal).

Then lets try add in one Huel Black drink per day at 400 kcal which totals at 2278 kcal (362 short of 2500). This would be about £298.80 (£3.16/meal) or £268.92 with student/NHS discount (£2.84/meal).

So assuming I haven't made any horrible errors in my maths £2.84/meal still is pretty damn good. £268.92 seems expensive but for a month of food it might not even be that bad (again very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel). I think what I might do is buy a 20kg bag of basmati rice and throw it in the rice cooker which should boost the calories much higher and cheaper which I can combine with the Huel meals. Or throw in some naan bread etc. Huel is still great and it's definitely better than my standard diet both in nutrition and cost regardless."

I'm Mazey-Jessica, a transgender woman and pre all ops, and I'm looking at SRS, however, I am still new to the whole operation scene, but want them so badly. My online group said here was a good place where i could put my questions. I am in the UK, so UK doctors/practices would be brilliant, as I'm going private for this. My online reseach brought up many terms that I couldnt understand and I kept getting lost rabbit holes of looking what words mean.  
My questions are:

1) What is the difference between all the different methods of SRS, I know there is vaginoplasty and vulvoplasty, but I don't know what is what, as I said, I don't know anything. 

2) Is there any risks that I should worry about in each method (anything goes here, can be from ones that are common, to ones that are rare, however please catagorize them)

3) How good is the functionality of each method (like Q2, please catogorize them)

4) After SRS when can I start doing everything again? Ie having sex, being able to swim in chlorinated water, showering ect ect.

5) Any clinic in the UK anyone that anyone reccomend with pricing ranges, that would be helpful."

They started blowing up sometimes last year, and people always say because people ""expressing themselves or finding themselves"" mate how is your past life ""you"" if its not your current life but a past life?? Like that logic itself contradicts itself as well. It's awfully weird how literally 99 percent of therians are stuff like a fox or a dog or a cat but never something like an microorganism or an centipede. If therians are valid why are most of them cats or foxes etc and there's like barely ever any centipedes or ants. Like a lot more centipedes and ants have been killed when compares to cats lmao.They speak about shifts but then you have to wonder to yourself if they are pretending / convinced themseleves or if they have another mental disorder. I wouldn't attack a therian or hurt them or whatnot but I just can't wrap my head around it. I've sat and done research on research but therians are just contradicting themselves.
Some therians say ""we dont believe we were animals in our past life we believe we are spiritually connected"" and some say ""we only believe we were animals in our past lives"" now what does your past life have to do with your current life?? You can't remember what you had for breakfast a week ago but remember a whole ass past life?? Man wtf

Now according to the ny post:

**""Other research, conducted by Helen Clegg of the UK's University of Northampton, suggests that some therians may have higher levels of schizotypy, or schizotypal personality disorder. STPD is a condition marked by intense discomfort with social interactions and personal relationships""**

The same people who are therians today hated on the weird human collie dude a few years ago??? 

Physical transformation is impossible now there's no evidence but that belief. If you were an animal in your past life and have shifts etc why don't you eat your family and eat your pets or some shit?? Lmao


They experience species dysphoria too which is linked to other mental illnesses.

Interesting how most therians have a mental illness or struggle with depression or anxiety (which is also linked with species dysphoria)

Can't you just link zoanthropy to therianthropy??

2024-04-11 15:05:48,Question for anyone who fenced before 1987 - Turning your back in the 1980s,3,1c1he6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fencing/comments/1c1he6o/question_for_anyone_who_fenced_before_1987/,0,1712847948.0,"I've gone on deep dive into the History of the turning your back rule. The earliest reference to turning your back not being allowed I could find was:

>There are a variety of other bad customs equally deserving of reprehension as becoming a genteel fencer; such, for example, as crying out after every thrust , and turning their back upon their adversary when too much or too closely pressed by him, either for the purpose of arresting his impetuosity or frustrating his design, or to get it decided whether or not his stance of which thrust was irregularly given, when he not been able to keep it off in the impulsion .

>Turning the back in this manner, either through imprudence or custom in a serious affair, is very justly condemned, for, could such a circumstance who might, be alleged in excuse for being wrongfully touched, if the fencer so turning his back were to receive a thrust owing to his having irregularly defended himself?

The Modern Art of Fencing 1822, pg 215-216:

https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Modern_Art_of_Fencing/d38w2eHuaVYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA216&printsec=frontcover

Which feels very similar to the idea that turning your back is unfair because it causes a halt.

So then I traced forward through various rulebooks. The AFLA rules from the late 1800s are all very sparse, and it's quite clear that they don't intend to cover all circumstances ([Roughly 20 rules in total](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1891.pdf)) so there's no mention of turning.

But then as I trace up through the [1940s rules](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1940.pdf), up to the [1970s](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1974.pdf), they all have something to this effect:

> In foil and sabre such movements as the displacement of the target, side-stepping, turns and half-turns, are permitted, but the reversal of positions on the strip is forbidden. Therefore, if the original positions are actually reversed, the contestants shall be placed back in the positions which they occupied at the moment the reversing movement was begun.

-AFLA Rules from 1940

Which explicitly allows turning, and makes no mention of turning causing a halt.


*Weirdly as an somewhat related aside - the 1950 rules seem to allow epee fencers to pass each other and keep fencing, and end up on opposite sides*

> *Reversing of Positions. EPEE.*

> *Movements which result in the reversal of the 88 original positions of the competitors are allowed on condition that they are executed without jostling the opponent. . The reversed position is secured if the reversal is more than half executed when the president of the jury gives the order "" Halt.""*

The earliest I example of turning causing a halt or a Yellow card is the 1987 USFA rules

https://imgur.com/a/5IVljMq

http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/USFA-Rules-1987-with-Operations-Manual.pdf

----

So the question is - what the fuck? Could you completely turn your back without penalty before 1987? or was it just one of those conventions that caused a halt and never was explicitly written down until the 1980s?"

Just wanted to provide a timeline of events to date:

\- Moved in 2020  
\- Tenancy expired years ago, on a rolling tenancy  
\- Deposit wasn't protected (Currently have a deposit not protected claim, [old thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bhukxh/used_a_no_win_no_fee_solicitor_for_deposit_not/))  
\- They gave us a section 21 notice and then withdrew it after we told them it's not valid. 

The property in question has been neglected by the landlord. It's had no gas safety certificate for years, boiler was replaced recently by landlord when the last gas safety failed (our lives were at risk from it according to the gas safety engineer due to products of combustion). House has mould everywhere. My mum had to call the police after being pushed hard by the landlord on one occasion (She's nearly 70 and has trouble walking as is), she was sympathetic decided not to pursue charges, we just don't allow landlord visits now unless it's for safety reasons (gas safety, etc). My mum does plan to move from here but I've told her to drag out the process until the local housing allowance is raised in 2025 hopefully, as my mum is disabled/doesn't work and rent is unaffordable in London at this point. 

I posted a thread about this back here:

**So fast forward to today, we've received a letter from the agency that the rent will increase from next month, are we fine to just ignore it and continue paying the same rent?** We did this before when they asked us previously, we just ignored it. It wasn't a Section 13 rent increase form, which I think it needs to be on, it's it's just a few lines of text on a piece of paper that they will increase it. We're happy for them to go through the Section 21 process but from what I understand they can never issue the Section 21 now since the deposit wasn't originally protected and since there's no gas safety cert?

2024-04-11 15:02:29,High Cost of Inconsistency of Prescription Cannabis: Navigating the Challenges,1,1c1hb70,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1c1hb70/high_cost_of_inconsistency_of_prescription/,0,1712847749.0,"#### Introduction

**In recent years, the United Kingdom has taken tentative steps towards recognizing cannabis for its medicinal properties, offering a glimmer of hope to those suffering from chronic pain and other debilitating conditions. However, this hope is frequently dimmed by the stark reality of inconsistent supply, leaving patients in a precarious limbo. This blog delves into the profound disappointment and pain felt by patients due to these supply issues, and examines the wider repercussions for legislative progress in the realm of prescription cannabis within the UK.**

#### The Emotional Toll of Inconsistent Supply

**For many patients, prescription cannabis is not a luxury; it’s a lifeline. The emotional toll of the supply’s inconsistency is profound. Imagine planning your life around a medication that can vanish from the pharmacy shelves without warning. Patients like Sarah (a pseudonym to protect privacy), who suffers from multiple sclerosis, describes the situation as “living on a seesaw,” where her ability to manage pain and maintain a semblance of normalcy is constantly in flux.**

**This inconsistency breeds not just disappointment but severe anxiety. Patients are left wondering not if, but when their supply will run out, forcing them into a cycle of stress that can exacerbate their conditions. Families watch helplessly as their loved ones grapple with the uncertainty, creating an additional emotional strain on already burdened households.**

#### Physical Consequences of Supply Disruptions

**The interruption in supply doesn’t just disrupt lives emotionally; it has tangible physical repercussions. When patients are forced to abruptly stop their cannabis-based treatments, the consequences can be dire. The return of chronic pain, the resurgence of seizures, and the increased intensity of symptoms can push patients back to square one, negating months or even years of progress.**

**Healthcare professionals, too, are caught in this dilemma. Doctors and nurses, who have seen the benefits of consistent treatment, find themselves unable to promise stability to their patients. Dr. Richardson, a pain specialist, highlights the frustration of “knowing what could help my patients, yet being powerless to assure them of continuous treatment.”**

#### Legislative Stagnation: A Barrier to Progress

**The journey of prescription cannabis in the UK is mired in legislative caution, a reflection of the complex global stance on cannabis. Despite evidence of its benefits, the inconsistency in supply has given lawmakers pause, slowing the momentum for further legalization and integration into the healthcare system. Critics argue that these supply issues serve as ammunition for opponents of prescription cannabis, complicating efforts to present it as a reliable and effective treatment option.**

**The impact of these supply inconsistencies extends beyond patient care; they shape the narrative around cannabis legislation. Lawmakers, faced with the challenge of ensuring a steady supply, may become hesitant to expand access, fearing the backlash from potential shortages. This hesitancy feeds into a vicious cycle, where legislative progress is stalled, further entrenching supply issues.**

#### The Ripple Effect on Healthcare and Society

**The ramifications of inconsistent cannabis supply ripple through the healthcare system and society. Healthcare providers, tasked with managing patient expectations and treatment plans, often find themselves at the mercy of supply chains they can’t control. This unpredictability can undermine the patient-provider trust relationship, crucial for effective care.**

**Moreover, societal perceptions of cannabis as a legitimate medical treatment are influenced by these supply issues. Public confidence in cannabis as a medical solution wanes with each report of shortages, affecting societal acceptance and potentially delaying wider recognition and use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes.**

**The economic impact is also significant. Patients, many of whom already face financial challenges due to their health conditions, may incur additional costs seeking alternative treatments. Healthcare providers, for their part, must navigate the administrative and financial burdens of managing an unreliable medication supply.**

#### Towards a Solution: Pathways and Possibilities

**Addressing the inconsistency in prescription cannabis supply requires a multifaceted approach. Firstly, regulatory changes could ease some of the barriers to a steady supply, such as restrictions on importation and cultivation. Developing domestic production capabilities is another avenue, potentially reducing reliance on international sources and making supply chains more resilient.**

**Advocacy plays a crucial role. Patient voices and their stories of how cannabis has transformed their lives are powerful tools in shaping public opinion and legislative action. By bringing these stories to the forefront, there’s an opportunity to influence policy and create a more supportive environment for prescription cannabis.**

**A collaborative effort among stakeholders—government bodies, healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, and the cannabis industry—is essential. Together, they can work towards creating a reliable, effective, and accessible prescription cannabis system in the UK.**

#### Conclusion

**The path to integrating prescription cannabis into the UK’s healthcare system is fraught with challenges, not least of which is the inconsistency in supply. This issue not only affects patients directly, causing disappointment and physical suffering, but also hampers legislative progress and has broader implications for healthcare and society. However, by acknowledging these challenges and working collaboratively towards solutions, there’s hope for a future where prescription cannabis is accessible to all who need it, marking a significant step forward in patient care and treatment options.**

It was a guy talking over a compilation of reptiles and their eyes flickering. The video was strange because I couldn't find it elsewhere.

I was in hysterics of laughter because of his reaction. But something interesting was his stutters of words saying, ""They're f\*kn real, just look at those f\*ks!"" I got you, reptile f\*ks. It was interesting because it was a lot of celebs in interviews, and I grew up with friends with Tourette's, and I know they just spit mostly their thoughts. I was like, ""This dude is onto something here.""

So I did more research about celebs and found some Justin Bieber clip of him shifting at a police interview. I remember watching like, ""Oh, I remember seeing this years ago!"" Like it was a psyops, the entire Justin Bieber was arrested drama. I'm like, ""Hmm, what is it, psyops?"" And this, so I'm like, ""Let's try connecting these dots."" Then there's Adele's supposed article that got taken/wiped from the web. People talking about seeing it, but over the years, it was mostly forgotten about. But apparently, she shifted at her concert backstage, and no one cared really because they thought she was in a costume. But what I found eerie about the article is she supposed she said to her fans who seen her like a lizard, ""Don't worry, I'm one of the good ones."" So I'm like, ""Why is the website now on the info got a big stamp with FALSE written like you needed to know that specifically?"" Just like the crazy teacher from Incredibles film goes, ""Coincidence? I think not!"" Was my brain at that point. After that, I just learned about the reptilians thanks to lots of smart people discussing on here and the obvious low-level toxic mind games people attempt to dismiss the entire subject as very noticeable, like they are in on it, but that was likely bots or people just with no intellectual thoughts so trolls basically. 

Currently, though, I see the UK government being run by the most obvious reptile, Rishi Sunak, the big annoying psyops that feeds on your soul, as in mental energy, same with US President Biden that is obviously a clone or something is odd with that dude anyway. I heard Biden died, and his brother took his spot, but that's a different conspiracy that goes mad. I'm just spitballing now; Kanye West feels like a psyops, especially after he went missing and mentioned they controlled him before he went missing. The royals are the most obvious too; you just can't miss that psyops, and I believe they got Diana as they knew it would be a feast of energy they feed on, but hey, that's just a theory! A reptile theory!"

Many people are assuming he'll be more active here than at PBC. The key name at 147 appears to be Conor Benn, who likely can't fight in the UK - thus needs a big US name (Hearn may also see this as cashing out, with Boots having a higher ceiling). 

However, we also know that Devin Haney rehydrated to like 165lbs for his 140lb fight against Regis Prograis. Devin is fighting Garcia, and may someday fight Lopez and Matias, but after that... Could he move up to 147 sooner than expected?

Haney-Ennis would be one the highest level US fights that Matchroom has ever promoted. I'm curious if Matchroom could end up in a similar spot to what PBC had in 147, with Spence, Porter, Ugas & Garcia. 

What do you think?"
2024-04-11 14:57:52,Friend forgot their railcard for a train almost a year ago. Now expected to pay £550 in five days with zero prior notice.,1,1c1h6yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1c1h6yj/friend_forgot_their_railcard_for_a_train_almost_a/,3,1712847472.0,"Never thought I'd be posting in a place like this but I'm so pissed off for my friend right now and need as much information I can get on this to help, because this doesn't seem right at all.

As the title says, they paid for their ticket (I think Trans-Pennine) under a railcard which they couldn't present, a small journey which would've only skived them out of £5. (I know this isn't the rules for a penalty fare, but they have email proof of owning one). Conductor asked them for their details and could only remember him saying the rail would 'contact them and sort something out'. They never got anything back from them. No letter, no 21 day reminder email, nothing. 

In the situation of my friend who has hardship funds in place of the uni they're studying at, it would be pretty fair for them to assume the rail's let them off since they've been silent about it. Additionally, they are registered disabled. Ten months later they get a Magistrate's court fine in the post from Marston, asking them to pay £550 in five days, or face the usual baliff bollocks where they start confiscating. From what I've heard from my friend, citizens advice and Marston's said there's nothing they can do to cancel, or even lower the fine (even though it was due to a LOT of negligence on their part), and the absolute best they get is to have to set up a payment plan to pay the entire thing over 12 months. 

This fine goes so far against their policy on treating people in situations like my friend's, according to this page: [https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/](https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/) \- specifically the parts about a fine this large having a strong financial impact on them (their family lives on the poverty line), and the fact that they are given only five days to pay it.

This whole thing sounds incredibly predatory and mishandled and I feel like there must be something more to investigate about this. I know there's a lot of ambiguity in proving that no contact was sent prior, but supposing that there absolutely wasn't anything, what would be the outcome from there? 

Please lmk if there's anything else important to note because I am trying to keep this as anonymous as possible out of respect for my friend, who is naturally pretty fucking terrified right now.  TY"

I (26 M) am moving to the UK end of April from Spain. I have some money that I would like to start investing as well as an X amount per month as soon as the moving is done. I have never invested before and I am a bit lost of how moving countries could impact it. So let me bullet point my questions to make it easier:

- Can I start investing while in Spain and then continue in UK? Do brokers usually allow this or would I have to sell everything and buy again?
- A friend of mine who also lived in the UK told me that what he did is having his address still in Spain while living there, so he was technically investing from here. This was before Brexit. Is this legal and recommended? I thought having the visa and working there invalidates my current living address in Spain
- I do plan to stay in UK couple years and then most likely move around Europe until, at some point, going back to Spain (but who knows, maybe I stay in UK my whole live). Considering this, are ISAs still a valid approach? They have good tax benefits but if I retrieve the money while in another country I would get taxed normally and I could not keep adding money there. It seems that if I move, start an ISA and then in two years I leave I would have to sell stocks and buy them again, which sounds bad… (?). 
- Having all this in mind, what broker would you use? People have recommended me Vanguard, Fidelity, MyInvestor and even some banks. My plan is 95% index funds and maybe couple stocks just to try

It's supposed to be a review on how the uk handles trans kids and adolescence in light of the recent Bell v Tavistock case. The problem is Dr Hilary Cass has a clear prejudice that she pours into her work and gets approval from other abhorrent people such as the PM Rishi Sunak or JK Rowling. The biggest fear I have with it is that its already making a difference, there are already calls for several NHS GIC's to close and reevaluate how they interact with patient care for trans youths. Its genuinely concerning because it doesn't just pick out trams children, but now anyone under 25. We're slipping down this hill straight into the jaws of a genocide and it's terrorfying.

When reading the review, it paints itself put to be a review designed to protect kids. It then goes on to say we don't know enough about puberty blockers to deem them safe (despite the fact that we do and still perscribe them to cis kids). Like it straight up ignores 50 years of reaserch on something that has been proven safe and is still administerd other children in a similar vein. It goes on to talk about how the human brain isn't fully developed until you're 25, so we should make the system harder for people under 25 to prevent any mistakes. Like this just blatantly ignores the fact that medical gac has one of the lowest regret rates out there and is extremely successful.

It says to look for external factors like ADHD or Autism, like either of thoes would change the gender incongruence?? Like yeah, lots of trans people are neurdivergent, but that changes nothing since u can't ""cure"" neurdivergence and gac is still proven to work ridiculously well in helping trans people, regardless of neurological wiring. Then it claims that, because of bullying and transphobia, kids should be discouraged from socially transitioning. ""Hey kids, are you sick of being bullied?? Well why don't you change your name and build a new life for yourself!"" Like are you seriously gonna victim blame on an actual medical report like it isn't people like YOU (Dr Hilary Cass) who encourage that bullying and transphobia!

Even ignoring all of that, it still takes seriously concerns that pretty much all major Western medical organisations know to be false. Like the idea that trans kids don't exist. The document that is supposed to be helping trans kids, humouring the idea that they don't exist. It's such a translucent exercise of cis-superiority that would be generous to imply arrogance and alleviate any malice intent from the equation. It gives a platform to bigots to stand on ""don't believe me, well in section 12:14 of the Cass Review it clearly states...(some dribble about social transitioning being wrong)."" I saw a tweet from a JK Rowling fan saying that the cast need to apologise to her for their remarks in support of the trans community and she responded (roughly) ""I wouldn't accept it."" THEY WERE RIGHT!! JK deserves no apology from anyone, but now she has a government approved document to validate her bigotry.

What scariest of all is how close we are to being a genuinely unsafe country for trans people. How many kids are gonna kill themselves because of this review? How many people are going to be assaulted and beaten up because of this document?? Last time rishi made a joke about trans people hate crime towards trans people took a significant rise in the UK, I dread to see what's gonna happen because of this. "

Would also love to know about any swaps you guys would recommend. 

AM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

Then, I alternate between

2. NIOD GHKCU - Keen for a more potent version of this 

Or

3. Timeless 20% Vitamin C Ferulic Acid Vitamin C – When I used TO vitamin C powder at night I used to see a wee difference in my complextion when I woke up but with this I don’t so wondering if anyone can recommend something better that isnt TO- as I didnt like the texture and cba with the mixing.

4. La Roche Psay Invisible fluid - guess this is fine for now but would love to know of tinted sun creams that are good for pale, cool undertoned skin. 

 PM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

5. Dermatica tretinoin 0.015%/Niacinamide 4% Azelaic Acid 4% Every second night with 1 weeks break before and after microneedling 

On the nights I am not using Tret I use the 2. NIOD or 3. Timeless depending on what I used in the morning 

5. Dermatica ceramide and peptide moisturiser - keen to swap this out as it seems over priced for what it is 

Once a week or once every fortnight a TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution depending on microneedling healing stage 

Microneedle approx once a month following the Pen Smit protocol 

Concerns in order of priority:

Pinkish, purple under eye circles which are often puffy, particularly on the right side. I’ve had these for as long as I can remember and am almost accepting that blepharoplasty is probably the only intervention that will remove them. Until I can afford surgery ( I live I the UK) I really hope that microneedling and RLT help reduce them and think I should also look into whether underlying health issues or allergys could be contributing to them but find it quite overwhelming and not really sure where best to start, what tests to prioritse, how long I would have to exclude something or say, take allergy meds to know… Wow they really get me down like I look SO sick and I dream of feeling comfortable make up free. 

Redness under nose, like a pink moustache that isnt particularly textured beyond what you would expect from spots. Have had this for as long as I can remember, wonder if it is from blowing my nose in the cold frequently (used to skate) or from a steroid cream I v vaguely remember being prescribed something.

General uneven looking complexion – blotchy, spots take ages to fade and up close you can see that my skin is soooo congested, I have white heads, black heads, pustules pretty much everywhere apart from my jaw. Possibly mild rosacea type 2 which might be why I randomly got blepharitus which is now reacurring. Not figured that out yet, god so much is up! Though I came for product recommendations I am also wondering if there are there any Derms or aestheticians that would let me DM them some photos? I feel like I need to show my face in its entirety both up close and selfie distance in various lights to get a good idea of what my skin is like and some features I have are pretty identifiable and though the changes are slim I would be mortified if someone I know saw them.

&#x200B;

Anyway, back to the main reason I am posting - 

 I was considering these products linked below which are a bit out of budget and not easy to get hold of as I am not US based and got stuck on whether the added kojic acid and alpha arbutin in [Brightening Tranexamic Acid Treatment – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/multi-bright-tranexamic-acid-treatment-5?_pos=1&_sid=0bb9e1337&_ss=r) would be an issue with GHKCU and the Tret 

and then when I considered  [Tranexamic Acid Serum – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/tranexamic-topical-acid-5?_pos=2&_sid=8227fd551&_ss=r)  with the added kojic acid and niacinamide gathered that I couldnt use this with vitamin C but got stuck on whether it would be ok following GHKCU / Tret"

I am close to waiving the white flag. I'm not one to call on the Universe for signs, but it sure feels like I'm not meant for the UK.

**Timeline:**

* Route: Ancestry Visa
* (Canadian) via my Paternal Grandparents
* Applied: Feb 1
* Biometrics: Feb 6
* Email 1 for additional information: Feb 19
* Email 2 for additional information: March 4
* Email 3 for additional information: March 18
* **Final decision refusal: March 28**
* Complaint submitted: April 2
* **Complaint not upheld: April 11**

**Refusal: ""***As above you did not respond to our emails requesting further information and you have not provided sufficient evidence that confirms the UK Ancestry link to your claimed grandparent.*""

https://preview.redd.it/r0j3b6okwutc1.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7cdd6187a2d15dd119c956f675f58aa8c90a096

**Birth Certificate:**

The letter states that I provided my ""Paternal Grandfathers death certificate."" 

I did not provide my grandfather's death certificate. The document is my father's birth certificate, whose middle name is my grandfather's first name. So I wondered if, at a quick glance, the assumption was that this document was of my grandfather. There is a deceased watermark on the document. I wonder if that, coupled with the similar names, resulted in a mixup. 

I will add that this document also clearly shows the names of my father's parents and has a large ""Birth Certificate"" title at the top. Not Death Certificate.

&#x200B;

**No Communication:**

In the emails asking for additional information, it was never mentioned that I provided my grandfather's death certificate. Only that they were not satisfied that I had provided enough evidence of an ancestral link. So, I assumed the original Birth Certificate was not sufficient. Thus, I gathered additional documents: **Act of Birth (long-form birth certificate),  Birth Certificate (original that I submitted), Baptismal Papers and my Grandparent's Marriage Certificate.**

The letter states that no communication was received in their attempts to follow up with me. This is untrue. I responded with the documents on the following dates:

**Email 1: March 1**

I sent an email to: [WorkNonSponsored.DocsRequested@fco.gov.uk](mailto:WorkNonSponsored.DocsRequested@fco.gov.uk) and received a confirmation auto-response of receipt.

**Email 2: March 24**

In response to an email stating that they still haven't heard from me, I replied to the email directly with the same information as provided on March 1. 

&#x200B;

**Complaint:** 

**April 2:** I submitted a complaint through the online form and directly to: [complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk](mailto:complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk)

The form did not allow me to provide an attachment, so I emailed with a very clear timeline, my documents, screenshots of my emails, and proof that they were received with the auto-email confirmation.

**April 11: Complaint not upheld**

https://preview.redd.it/ubwscn740vtc1.png?width=2076&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c5a3e0523e0fd93e9d658d3cf6f912ce44a92f2

Is my only option to apply for an administrative review? I do not have the option of waiting for a year. I also submitted my application before the new IHS increase, so re-applying means I will be paying a lot more. 

What I find frustrating is no one has addressed my points. All this complaint email reply confirms is that I've been refused. I feel like I am being forced to pay for a review. At this point, I would almost be happy if someone truly looked at my application and stated that they are rejecting me based on all of my evidence. 

Any advice or honest feedback, especially if there is a step where I've gone wrong, is appreciated. Feeling quite defeated..."

It's supposed to be a review on how the uk handles trans kids and adolescence in light of the recent Bell v Tavistock case. The problem is Dr Hilary Cass has a clear prejudice that she pours into her work and gets approval from other abhorrent people such as the PM Rishi Sunak or JK Rowling. The biggest fear I have with it is that its already making a difference, there are already calls for several NHS GIC's to close and reevaluate how they interact with patient care for trans youths. Its genuinely concerning because it doesn't just pick out trams children, but now anyone under 25. We're slipping down this hill straight into the jaws of a genocide and it's terrorfying.

When reading the review, it paints itself put to be a review designed to protect kids. It then goes on to say we don't know enough about puberty blockers to deem them safe (despite the fact that we do and still perscribe them to cis kids). Like it straight up ignores 50 years of reaserch on something that has been proven safe and is still administerd other children in a similar vein. It goes on to talk about how the human brain isn't fully developed until you're 25, so we should make the system harder for people under 25 to prevent any mistakes. Like this just blatantly ignores the fact that medical gac has one of the lowest regret rates out there and is extremely successful.

It says to look for external factors like ADHD or Autism, like either of thoes would change the gender incongruence?? Like yeah, lots of trans people are neurdivergent, but that changes nothing since u can't ""cure"" neurdivergence and gac is still proven to work ridiculously well in helping trans people, regardless of neurological wiring. Then it claims that, because of bullying and transphobia, kids should be discouraged from socially transitioning. ""Hey kids, are you sick of being bullied?? Well why don't you change your name and build a new life for yourself!"" Like are you seriously gonna victim blame on an actual medical report like it isn't people like YOU (Dr Hilary Cass) who encourage that bullying and transphobia!

Even ignoring all of that, it still takes seriously concerns that pretty much all major Western medical organisations know to be false. Like the idea that trans kids don't exist. The document that is supposed to be helping trans kids, humouring the idea that they don't exist. It's such a translucent exercise of cis-superiority that would be generous to imply arrogance and alleviate any malice intent from the equation. It gives a platform to bigots to stand on ""don't believe me, well in section 12:14 of the Cass Review it clearly states...(some dribble about social transitioning being wrong)."" I saw a tweet from a JK Rowling fan saying that the cast need to apologise to her for their remarks in support of the trans community and she responded (roughly) ""I wouldn't accept it."" THEY WERE RIGHT!! JK deserves no apology from anyone, but now she has a government approved document to validate her bigotry.

What scariest of all is how close we are to being a genuinely unsafe country for trans people. How many kids are gonna kill themselves because of this review? How many people are going to be assaulted and beaten up because of this document?? Last time rishi made a joke about trans people hate crime towards trans people took a significant rise in the UK, I dread to see what's gonna happen because of this. "

I've already created two map visuals. The visual on the left is made from Table 1, and the visual on the right is from Table 2.

I get not talking to the police in case you say something incriminating but to refuse to answer basic questions like ""do you understand?"" and ""are you ok?"" was very weird.

I originally took it to be Ruby taking Jodi/lawyers advice to the extreme however when watching a video on YouTube (for the life of me I cannot remember which one - there have been so many) that went into the timeline of what happened and where everyone was, something struck me. The video included all the 911 operators calls and how she coordinated it all. When they worked out who R's mother was, they said the only thing they had on file for her was a driving offense recently.

Whoever did the video then included the bodycam footage of that traffic stop and Ruby behaves in a similar way, barely speaking actually barely looking at the officer. 

Anyone shed any light on this behaviour? Or is this normal for people to behave in the US towards police officers? (I'm UK based)

But overall, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd assume the work is similar / the same and pays relatively similar. I'd also really appreciate some insight on positives and negatives of this trade in the US as where I am in the UK it has felt like 70% of the day is spent in the van between jobs in traffic especially on maintenance & repair side of things, which is something I wouldn't miss if it's any different in the US.

However, his first challenge is from a former WWE Champion, Sheamus, who doesn't win the United States Championship in this universe. After winning the Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal at Wrestlemania, Sheamus wins a fatal four-way also involving Bobby Lashley, Braun Strowman and The Miz. Instead of getting too directly involved with McIntyre, Sheamus focuses on winning matches and proving himself as a viable challenger. During these matches, McIntyre seems to be scouting Sheamus, going on commentary and watching at ringside. At Backlash, the two men beat the piss out of each other. At one point, Drew McIntyre breaks Sheamus' nose with an elbow. The ending comes when the champion reverses White Noise into a Future Shock, and hits a Claymore for the victory.

In between Backlash and Hell In A Cell, Drew McIntyre has 2 championship defenses in NXT and NXT UK, against Tommaso Ciampa and Ilja Dragunov, further cementing his intent on showing off younger stars. He obviously retains both times, yet comes very close to losing both times. Ciampa gets a near-fall with an Air Raid Siren off the top rope, while Dragunov gets a near fall with a H-Bomb and the Torpedo Moscow.

On Raw, Drew McIntyre has begun a feud with Aleister Black, who has been undefeated since turning heel in November. He beats Kevin Owens in a #1 contenders match, and plays mind games with McIntyre in the build, even threatening his family. At Hell In A Cell, it is again a match where both men beat the piss out of each other. Both men are continuing to brawl, when Black goes for the Black Mass, which McIntyre ducks and hits the Claymore. The champion goes for the cover and Black somehow kicks out. The challenger gets on his knees, wanting McIntyre to hit another Claymore. He does it, goes for the cover, and wins. 

Going into Money In The Bank, McIntyre returns to his feud with The Club, now with Finn Balor who has returned from NXT. Despite this, Kevin Owens becomes #1 contender for the WWE Championship by defeating Styles clean, planting the seeds for The Club's break-up. In the build, Owens and McIntyre have to form an uneasy alliance to battle The Club, who keep meddling in their affairs. At Money In The Bank, The Club continue to get involved, at one point inadvertantly helping Kevin Owens stay in the match by putting his foot on the rope after the champion goes for the cover after a Claymore. Towards the end of the match, The Club attempt to get involved physically, yet Owens and McIntyre fight them off. When they finally clear them, the challenger goes for the Stunner when the champion's back is turned, yet McIntyre pushes him off and hits a Claymore for the victory. After the match, The Club attack both men, and Finn Balor holds up the WWE Championship, with AJ Styles looking on in envy.

Towards Summerslam, Drew McIntyre is caught up in the ongoing civil war within The Club. A 16-man #1 contenders tournament is made for the night after Money In The Bank to determine the WWE Championship challenger. AJ Styles beats Bobby Lashley and Finn Balor beats Kofi Kingston to make a Club final. In the final, Luke Gallows immediately punch both men at the same time, leading to a no-contest. After the match, Finn Balor states that it was their plan all along to get to the final and make it a no-contest, leading to a triple threat match being made for Summerslam. The following week on Raw, Drew McIntyre defeats AJ Styles in a rematch from Wrestlemania after Finn Balor accidentally costs his friend the match. Finn Balor attempts to help Styles up after the match, yet is shoved to the ground. The following week, Finn Balor defeats Drew McIntyre. On the go-home show, Balor and Styles, who are still not on great terms, battle against Drew McIntyre and a mystery partner. This mystery partner turns out to be Jinder Mahal, partly reuniting 3MB. McIntyre and Mahal win after Finn Balor accidentally hits Styles with a Shotgun Dropkick, leading to McIntyre hitting Styles with a Claymore to pin him and get the win. At Summerslam, Balor and Styles attempt to get along and take out McIntyre, and it works originally when they put him through the announce table with a Phenomenal Forearm. Inevitably however, it falls apart, and the men battle it out for 10 minutes. After a Double Clothesline, both men are down, and McIntyre regains the advantage. He is about to win the match with a Claymore, yet Gallows and Anderson come out and attack the champion. Styles and Balor join in, and after a 1916 on a chair, McIntyre is rendered out of the match completely. After this, it looks like the two challengers are going to be able to finish their battle. However, Gallows, Anderson and Balor turn to Styles, and beat the shit out of him. Gallows and Anderson hit the Magic Killer, and Balor hits two Coup De Grace's to win the match and the WWE Championship, turning on his best friend."

So far I've:
- washed the plant in the shower with plain water (preserving the soil because I don't have any to replace it with)
- I trimmed away (or pulled out) the brown crunchy dried leaves and stems
- with advice I made a dish soap, isopropyl alcohol and water mix in a spray bottle that I doused my plant with for a few days then did it less regularly like once a week ish because I was scared
- recently I put dish soap on a tissue and gave the leaves wipe to remove the white flakes I found on the leaves and the grown brown scales on others

When I got the plant, after trimming the green leaves were almost fully green but some of the tips of the leaves had browned and dried out. I'm noticing now that some of the previously fully green leaves are losing their green pigment and turning brown throughout. In fact, I'm noticing one of the new leaves that hasn't fully unfurled is turning brown too which is why I'm scared.

This is my first plant and I don't know what to do. I'm based in the UK for reference - I'd love some help on what this looks like to you and if you think I can save it please 🙏🏼 I'm hoping there's an ""easy"" way to save it.

Thank you xo
PS: there's one weird bunched up leaf in the last picture. It's been a few weeks and it hasn't opened up like some of the other new leaves. I'm thinking to cut it off? Thoughts?"

There has been many issues I have encountered, so I decided to summarize here so others can benefit.

**Limitations:**

* You need a dock with Ethernet capability. Mine is [JSAUX 6-in-1 docking station](https://jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck).
* Easier to work with local network. If you want to do WOL over the internet, you need to setup port forwarding yourself, or configure a VPN (such as tailscale) to redirect your connection to one of your active computer/server in your home
* Steam is not officially supporting this feature. So it might break on future update.
* Do it at your own risk. Although everything I do is relatively safe, do not run commands from internet if you dont know what it will does to your system.

1. Unlock the readonly mode and make a sudo account. Please refer to other guides to do so. To confirm, try to install the packages we will need for checking later.

&#8203;

    $ sudo pacman -S gnu-netcat 

2. Get the ethernet *interface,* IP address, *MAC address,* and *broadcast address.* In the example below, *enp4s0f3u1u4* is the interface, and 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx is my MAC address, 163.xxx.xxx.xx is my IP address, and 163.xxx.xxx.255 is my broadcast address

&#8203;

    $ ip a
    5: enp4sxxxxxx: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 163.xxx.xxx.xx/xx brd 163.xxx.xxx.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp4s0f3u1u4

3. Enable the WOL feature of your network card. After querying ethtool interface, if Wake-on is ""d"", it means the feature is currently disabled. Then you need to set the value to ""g"". To make the changes persistent, please refer to the [archwiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wake-on-LAN).

&#8203;

    $ sudo ethtool enp4sxxxxxx | grep Wake-on
    
    Supports Wake-on: pumbag
    Wake-on: d
    
    $ sudo ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g

4. For the purpose of debugging, you can stop the firewall. It is not necessary for the WOL to works though. 

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl stop firewalld

5. Install a wake-on-lan application on your mobile phone, such as [this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.mrwebb.wakeonlan&hl=en&gl=US). Configure the MAC address, broadcast address, and IP address appropriately, and set WOL port to 9.
6. On your steamdeck, make sure firewall is disabled, and try to run the following command. While the command is running, try to press the send the WOL magic packet from your phone. If it works properly, then you will see some output on your steamdeck.

&#8203;

    $ sudo nc --udp --listen --local-port=9 --hexdump
    
    �������Lh��Lh��Lh��Lh����Lh��Lh�.... Received 102 bytes from the socket
    00000000  FF FF FF FF  FF FF 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  ........Lh....Lh
    00000010  17 E3 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  17 E3 00 E0  ....Lh....Lh....
    ...

7. If the previous part is working, congratulation, you can try to sleep your steamdeck and send the magic package from your phone to wake it up. Now you can reenable your firewall

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld

8. But, you might notice that, after the deck is sleeping for >15s, it will no longer wake up the deck. It leads to the second part to modify the ethernet power management. 
9. First, we need to find the appropriate usb devices for our ethernet. To do so, run lsusb. Try to list down all the ID for the Ethernet adapter, in my case, it's all the devices that starts with Realtek semiconductor, i.e. ""0bda:8153"", ""0bda:0411"", ""0bda:5411""

&#8203;

    $ sudo lsusb
    
    Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 003 Device 003: ID 13d3:3553 IMC Networks Bluetooth Radio
    Bus 003 Device 002: ID 28de:1205 Valve Software Steam Controller
    Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 0bda:8153 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8153 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter
    Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0bda:0411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. Hub
    Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 001 Device 004: ID 3434:0311 Keychron Keychron V1
    Bus 001 Device 003: ID 17ef:60e4 Lenovo Lenovo Legion M300 RGB Gaming Mouse
    Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0bda:5411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTS5411 Hub
    Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

10. The previous ID format is given as ""idVendor:idProduct"". We now need to find the appropriate driver for the those three usb devices. Run the following two commands, and pinpoint which usb devices corresponds to the IDs. 

&#8203;

    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idVendor
    ...
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/idVendor <==
    0bda
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/idVendor <==
    0bda
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/idVendor <==
    0bda
    ...
    
    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idProduct
    ...
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/idProduct <==
    5411
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/idProduct <==
    8153
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/idProduct <==
    0411
    ,,,
    

1. Check and enable the power management for these devices.  

&#8203;

    ## change the paths appropriately
    
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup
    disabled
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup
    enabled
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup
    disabled
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup""
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup""
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup""

11. Test to see if the WOL is working fine now. 
12. If it's working fine, you can make the changes persistent by writing a systemd service, as follows. Also after testing, turns out I dont need to enable ""1-1"" to make WOL work reliably.

&#8203;

    /etc/systemd/system/wol.service
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    [Unit]
    Description=Enable WOL usb
    Wants=network-pre.target
    After=network-pre.target NetworkManager.service
    
    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g ; sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup"" ; sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup""
    Restart=on-failure
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

13. Also, enable the unit.

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl enable wol.service

14. Profit! Enjoy your game by streaming to your deck from your mobile phone through Steam Link.

&#x200B;

**Caveats and TODOs:**

1. Only deck built in screen is turned on when turning on through WOL. If you have any suggestion how to turn on both displays, please let me know.
2. Haven't fully tested the systemd service yet."
2024-04-11 15:24:11,Ungrateful but I feel guilty if I stop doing what I should,1,1c1hu6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1c1hu6c/ungrateful_but_i_feel_guilty_if_i_stop_doing_what/,0,1712849051.0,"I have a narcissistic mom in her early 60's and I'm the youngest between me and my sister who is over a decade older than me.(30F,40F). From I've been 14 I've been helping with my mom's healthcare because she is diabetic etc. In my 20's I would be there mostly as her caregiver in the hospital and at home, sometimes financially when we would have to go to the hospital for an emergency and be there as emotional support.

Idk what but the caring mother I knew changed into a manipulative narcissistic character.

I'd realize growing up I would be labelled as the black sheep even though I always assisted heavily around the house everyday, followed rules but had my own bit of individuality I would be passionate about(piercings) but I always did well in school. I went through a traumatic situation that affected my university years and she would throw it in my face and call me mad(mentally unstable) even when she knows I am telling the truth. 

One time I told her something that another family member said about her and to get out of it, the person lied and tried to accuse me of making it up or being mad. My mother also berated me with those insults and say I must be mad. Later on, she found information confirming that I was telling the truth and never apologized. 

She also has a friend from the UK she knows from her childhood that she only talks about my older sister with and her kids. She never mentions any updates about me or good things with me.

We live in a family home(30F) with other family members but I take care of her daily. In our neighbourhood when we have an argument she would be on the top of her lungs calling me mental and making it seem to others as if I suffer from mental health issues. Quite a few people in the neighbourhood know me and she has no qualms embarassing me. In the country I live there are severe negative connotations and stigma associated with mental health issues and alot of people who suffer from this disease are met with violence.

At this point, this is one of the things she constantly says on the top of her voice. Living in a neighbourhood where people can easily hear this and spread gossip, I believe she chooses to do this to me because no matter what I always come back and help her and speak to her. Whereby with my older sister, she couldnt do or say half of these things to her without significant repercussions or my sister deciding to not speak with her again or allow her to see her children. 

I hate toxicity and even though I have my flaws I hate that I have to be consistently berated, attacked and embarassed but feel guilty if I put my foot down and stop caring for her. I dont deserve this treatment and its crazy because everybody else sees her as a nice sweetheart but she has some terrible narcissistic traits that are hurtful. 

She throws rocks and hides her hands and no matter what I do for her, sacrifice for her... its never enough.

I put studying last, classes, things I have to do JUST so I can be able to care for her and give her the things she needs to be comfortable. I put myself 2nd or last but I seem to be the most hated.

I even get blamed for situations where I am the victim and didnt do anything to deserve it. 

So my question is, should I just move out and cut all ties or stay a little longer(by the end of the year) and let them know I will be moving out by then so they can arrange other plans?

My mental health is declining because of how I am being treated and I cannot continue to allow this anymore. I am deeply hurt and keep getting hurt in every corner of my life.

I left out alot of details but I have always been there with my mother through thick and thin and even though my older sister is in a better financial position than I at the moment I always try to do the best that I can.

I hope someone understands me at the very least. I'm not putting myself as this woe is me character ...I dont have any issues having my mother as the biggest priority in my life but shes very disrespectful and hurtful too many times and I dont think I can continue to take it.

I bought an unused tube of Melamet off Vinted and I started using it (just on the upper lip area) last year. I probably only used it consistently for 2 weeks in the evening, and I was really careful in the sunlight afterward (factor 50!) It faded this winter (I’m UK-based) but then I started using Glycolic Acid toner consistently to help with my hormonal acne. Whilst it helped a lot with the acne, it’s now made my hyperpigmentation worse! I’ve been reading all the risks about hydroquinone and I don’t want to use it again I( was stupid for even using it in the first place).

Do you think I’ve done any damage by using it for that brief period, and what safe alternatives are there to help minimise fade the tan-mustache?! "

All the clubs I've found so far are either barely active, disorganised, on bits of the Hudson that don't look particularly fun to sail on or essentially social clubs.

The biggest in the area seems Nyack. But any others I should check out?

Myself and my partner are preparing our application for an Unmarried Partner Family Visa - and were hoping to get some advice from the community at large - after a vary underwhelming encounter with an immigration firm we were hoping to use - who doesn't seem to be up on the latest UKVI changes etc.   


I am originally from the US and have been in the UK for 3 years as of next week, on a student visa which expires in early May. My partner is a British citizen, and we have been together in a relationship for 2 years 1 month, and living together for 2 years.   


We have lived together at 2 different addresses within the UK and have an array of documents to prove this in each of our names, as well as joint documents.   


We also have some photos and letters of support from UK family and friends regarding our relationship - so I am not concerned about the relationship or cohabitation aspects of the application.   


The reason we have been seeking out professional advice in the first place, was that my partner was let go from his employer in Feb 2024, just as we were gearing up to start our application. He had been with that employer for nearly 2 years, making £75k and we have all of those payslips + bank statements.  


He found a new job shortly after being let go, at the same salary - but his start date at the new job is not until the 29th of April. We have the settlement agreement from the old employer, the offer letter from the new employer etc as well.   


My partner also receives PIP so this makes us exempt from meeting the standard requirement, and needing to show adequate maintenance instead.   


As far as I know, you can combine PIP + income to show this - and when combined with his salary in relation to our housing costs (rent and council tax) we more than meet adequate maintenance   


But I am not sure if or how the slight ""gap"" in payslips will impact us - or if it will, given we had ""income"" from the settlement agreement from the old employer and there is a new job offer on the table at the same salary level.   


I am not sure how to frame this in a cover letter, or what/how much financial documents to show - and after speaking to the basically useless immigration firm - I am now confused as to whether we can apply now - or need to wait for him to actually ""start"" the new job.   


 I have finished my degree and have the right to work full time on my current visa until it expires, as a student who has finished their degree - and I also have an offer letter for a job which I start soon and which will provide an additional amount of salary - if that is useful as well.   


At this point, other than knowing which financial documents to send, if we are still able to - as well as how or if this gap will impact us - I would rather handle this myself if at all possible - as all other aspects of the application are straight forward, and I like to be in control of matters like tis as well as aware of all correspondence - as opposed to letting someone who may do a bad job - try to do it for me.   


I would really appreciate any help or advice. Thanks so much!

They are somewhat collectible to me, but really don't have monetary value. The declared value on this package was £50. I am certain I saw this on the outside of the package when I received it and the shipper is confident that's what he notated as well. Fast forward a couple of weeks and I have now been sent a UPS bill for $416.97.

This, of course, is absolutely nuts. So I called the Customs Broker phone line, and they told me the declared value was showing as $2550. This makes no sense to me. I saw there is a dispute button, but I threw away the packaging weeks ago, so I really have no evidence to prove my case. Is there anyone specific I should contact or anything to do to prove this wrong or bring up in a dispute? It will only let me type 80 characters, which isn't even enough for a full sentence."

I am a beginner tinwhistle player but advanced enough so that I started feeling limitations of the cheapest whistles: I've got a Feadog in D but the higher half of the higher octave is so unreliable and poor (too airy) sounding that it often limits me in playing.
I've found a guy who has four used whistles to sell, all in nice condition and reasonable prices. All in D so I am trying to convince myself there is no reason (other than GAS) to buy more than one. Maybe two if there is a reasonable explanation (like totally different sound or something).  
The four models I am choosing between are:
- Tony Dixon DX004   (https://www.tonydixonmusic.co.uk/product/soprano-whistle-key-of-d-4/)  
- Tony Dixon DX204D   (https://reverb.com/uk/item/12021977-dixon-solid-brass-d-whistle-dx204d)  
- Killarney Nickel   (https://mcneelamusic.com/wind/killarney-nickel-d-whistle/)  
- Goldfinch   (https://goldfinch.eu/pl/whistles/flazolet-high-d-goldfinch/)  
  
Which one (or maybe more than one?) should I choose and why?  
What is important to me? Ease of playing as I am still on my learning curve. ;)  
I've looked for reviews and sound samples online but this didn't solve my problem: I like the sound of every one of them (and it's really hard to tell the true sound from YT videos) and I haven't found any obvious reason to choose one over other ones.  
Please help me, share your recommendations, things I should know or anything that can help me choose. ;)   
And please, don't tell me ""buy them all"". I am trying to fight GAS, not feed it!  
Thanks!"

The thing is, this started around July 2023, progressively getting worse. I'm constantly battling fatigue, headaches, slight blurry vision in my right eye, and get more pins & needles in my arms and legs than I used to. I drink plenty of water during the day, I hit enough calories but still this is happening. 

What concerns me is that I can't check for swollen lymph nodes in my arm pits, as I had chest masculinisation surgery in 2021 and have no feeling in my chest/armpit area at all. 

Before all this started, I had a lot of energy but now I struggle to do anything but sleep.

I've been on testosterone injections (prescribed) since the start of 2023, and get injected every 10 weeks by my doctor. 

I'm really at a loss as to what is going on."

Thank you to all who have participated in the survey so far, your input has been a great help. Just doing a 2nd wave of promotion for the study to try an increase the sample size.

I'm a final year undergraduate student on a live production based course. I am conducting a study as part of my dissertation which is aimed towards live sound engineers and touches on the topic of sound restrictions.

If you would like to participate in the study please use the following link:

https://linktr.ee/jakedaysound

The aim is to identify some of the most influential effects that sound restrictions have on the performance of live sound engineers, both positive and negative, as well as get broad feedback on how engineers can work more effectively under said restrictions.

I am very thankful to anybody who participates in the study and would like you all to know that this would help me out a great deal.

If you have any questions about the study I will be happy to answer them at the following email address: jd1741@my.acm.ac.uk

Thanks again and I hope you all have a grand day!

Huel seems fantastic to me because in my case the convenience is undeniably very helpful. Plus ADHD is the worst thing ever for meal planning and I like to be able to scale up/down my meals.

Huel is marketed as a meal replacement and a lot of people for drawn to it for losing weight. But in my case I need to gain a bit or maintain and I'm trying to hit the NHS 2500 calorie recommendation as that is roughly close to my baseline. The obvious solution is ""scoop more you idiot"" but the costs do seem to rise quite quickly. I might be wrong though as I am very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel.

Generally I make my own overnight oats and have them in the morning for breakfast plus a banana and tea which is about 547 kcal. Then lets have a hot & savory meal at lunch for 400 kcal, and then a hot and savory meal for dinner for another 400 kcal. I'll add on 120 kcal extra for the odd snack/tea. This totals at 1467 kcal so we're still 1033 kcal short of 2500. For those meals I'd need about 9 bags and it will cost around £167.40 (£2.65/meal) or £150.66 with student/NHS discount (£2.39/meal)

Some people have suggested using 3 scoops so we'll try that as well. 547 kcal for breakfast, 600 Huel H&S (Lunch), 600 Huel H&S (Dinner), and after adding on 120 kcal you get 1867 so still 633 kcal short of 2500. Going by my bad maths I'd need about 13 bags of Huel H&S at £223.20 (£3.98/meal) or £217.62 with student/NHS discount (£3.58/meal).

Then lets try add in one Huel Black drink per day at 400 kcal which totals at 2278 kcal (362 short of 2500). This would be about £298.80 (£3.16/meal) or £268.92 with student/NHS discount (£2.84/meal).

So assuming I haven't made any horrible errors in my maths £2.84/meal still is pretty damn good. £268.92 seems expensive but for a month of food it might not even be that bad (again very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel). I think what I might do is buy a 20kg bag of basmati rice and throw it in the rice cooker which should boost the calories much higher and cheaper which I can combine with the Huel meals. Or throw in some naan bread etc. Huel is still great and it's definitely better than my standard diet both in nutrition and cost regardless."

My online reseach brought up many terms that I couldnt understand and I kept getting lost rabbit holes of looking what words mean.  
My questions are:

1) What is the difference between all the different methods of SRS, I know there is vaginoplasty and vulvoplasty, but I don't know what is what, as I said, I don't know anything. 

2) Is there any risks that I should worry about in each method (anything goes here, can be from ones that are common, to ones that are rare, however please catagorize them)

3) How good is the functionality of each method (like Q2, please catogorize them)

4) After SRS when can I start doing everything again? Ie having sex, being able to swim in chlorinated water, showering ect ect.

5) Any clinic in the UK anyone that anyone reccomend with pricing ranges, that would be helpful."

They started blowing up sometimes last year, and people always say because people ""expressing themselves or finding themselves"" mate how is your past life ""you"" if its not your current life but a past life?? Like that logic itself contradicts itself as well. It's awfully weird how literally 99 percent of therians are stuff like a fox or a dog or a cat but never something like an microorganism or an centipede. If therians are valid why are most of them cats or foxes etc and there's like barely ever any centipedes or ants. Like a lot more centipedes and ants have been killed when compares to cats lmao.They speak about shifts but then you have to wonder to yourself if they are pretending / convinced themseleves or if they have another mental disorder. I wouldn't attack a therian or hurt them or whatnot but I just can't wrap my head around it. I've sat and done research on research but therians are just contradicting themselves.
Some therians say ""we dont believe we were animals in our past life we believe we are spiritually connected"" and some say ""we only believe we were animals in our past lives"" now what does your past life have to do with your current life?? You can't remember what you had for breakfast a week ago but remember a whole ass past life?? Man wtf

Now according to the ny post:

**""Other research, conducted by Helen Clegg of the UK's University of Northampton, suggests that some therians may have higher levels of schizotypy, or schizotypal personality disorder. STPD is a condition marked by intense discomfort with social interactions and personal relationships""**

The same people who are therians today hated on the weird human collie dude a few years ago??? 

Physical transformation is impossible now there's no evidence but that belief. If you were an animal in your past life and have shifts etc why don't you eat your family and eat your pets or some shit?? Lmao


They experience species dysphoria too which is linked to other mental illnesses.

Interesting how most therians have a mental illness or struggle with depression or anxiety (which is also linked with species dysphoria)

Can't you just link zoanthropy to therianthropy??

>There are a variety of other bad customs equally deserving of reprehension as becoming a genteel fencer; such, for example, as crying out after every thrust , and turning their back upon their adversary when too much or too closely pressed by him, either for the purpose of arresting his impetuosity or frustrating his design, or to get it decided whether or not his stance of which thrust was irregularly given, when he not been able to keep it off in the impulsion .

>Turning the back in this manner, either through imprudence or custom in a serious affair, is very justly condemned, for, could such a circumstance who might, be alleged in excuse for being wrongfully touched, if the fencer so turning his back were to receive a thrust owing to his having irregularly defended himself?

The Modern Art of Fencing 1822, pg 215-216:

https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Modern_Art_of_Fencing/d38w2eHuaVYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA216&printsec=frontcover

Which feels very similar to the idea that turning your back is unfair because it causes a halt.

So then I traced forward through various rulebooks. The AFLA rules from the late 1800s are all very sparse, and it's quite clear that they don't intend to cover all circumstances ([Roughly 20 rules in total](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1891.pdf)) so there's no mention of turning.

But then as I trace up through the [1940s rules](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1940.pdf), up to the [1970s](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1974.pdf), they all have something to this effect:

> In foil and sabre such movements as the displacement of the target, side-stepping, turns and half-turns, are permitted, but the reversal of positions on the strip is forbidden. Therefore, if the original positions are actually reversed, the contestants shall be placed back in the positions which they occupied at the moment the reversing movement was begun.

-AFLA Rules from 1940

Which explicitly allows turning, and makes no mention of turning causing a halt.


*Weirdly as an somewhat related aside - the 1950 rules seem to allow epee fencers to pass each other and keep fencing, and end up on opposite sides*

> *Reversing of Positions. EPEE.*

> *Movements which result in the reversal of the 88 original positions of the competitors are allowed on condition that they are executed without jostling the opponent. . The reversed position is secured if the reversal is more than half executed when the president of the jury gives the order "" Halt.""*

The earliest I example of turning causing a halt or a Yellow card is the 1987 USFA rules

So the question is - what the fuck? Could you completely turn your back without penalty before 1987? or was it just one of those conventions that caused a halt and never was explicitly written down until the 1980s?"

I'm looking at getting a new car instead to save in the long run but the garage are now saying they'd need me to pay £500 for the labour of a strip and fit.

Just wanted to provide a timeline of events to date:

\- Moved in 2020  
\- Tenancy expired years ago, on a rolling tenancy  
\- Deposit wasn't protected (Currently have a deposit not protected claim, [old thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bhukxh/used_a_no_win_no_fee_solicitor_for_deposit_not/))  
\- They gave us a section 21 notice and then withdrew it after we told them it's not valid. 

The property in question has been neglected by the landlord. It's had no gas safety certificate for years, boiler was replaced recently by landlord when the last gas safety failed (our lives were at risk from it according to the gas safety engineer due to products of combustion). House has mould everywhere. My mum had to call the police after being pushed hard by the landlord on one occasion (She's nearly 70 and has trouble walking as is), she was sympathetic decided not to pursue charges, we just don't allow landlord visits now unless it's for safety reasons (gas safety, etc). My mum does plan to move from here but I've told her to drag out the process until the local housing allowance is raised in 2025 hopefully, as my mum is disabled/doesn't work and rent is unaffordable in London at this point. 

I posted a thread about this back here:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bhukxh/used\_a\_no\_win\_no\_fee\_solicitor\_for\_deposit\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bhukxh/used_a_no_win_no_fee_solicitor_for_deposit_not/)

**So fast forward to today, we've received a letter from the agency that the rent will increase from next month, are we fine to just ignore it and continue paying the same rent?** We did this before when they asked us previously, we just ignored it. It wasn't a Section 13 rent increase form, which I think it needs to be on, it's it's just a few lines of text on a piece of paper that they will increase it. We're happy for them to go through the Section 21 process but from what I understand they can never issue the Section 21 now since the deposit wasn't originally protected and since there's no gas safety cert?

Hi everyone and thanks for clicking!

I'm from the UK, 36, and I'm retired. I have a law degree I basically got just for a challenge, and I want to go back to university soon. 

I'm really into video games, especially sim racing, VR, emulated stuff, but everything really. From AAA titles to indie games, across most genres.

I'm very into music, I play a bit of ukulele and guitar, make beats sometimes, and have a pretty wide range I listen to. Mostly rap but anything and everything. 

I love keeping fit, train in a lot of different sports including basketball, football, tennis, etc. I also cycle, play darts, pool and poker, and love to cook. 

I'm working on a couple of projects, got a book or two in the works that are in semi-active development. "
2024-04-11 15:02:29,High Cost of Inconsistency of Prescription Cannabis: Navigating the Challenges,1,1c1hb70,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1c1hb70/high_cost_of_inconsistency_of_prescription/,0,1712847749.0,"#### Introduction

**In recent years, the United Kingdom has taken tentative steps towards recognizing cannabis for its medicinal properties, offering a glimmer of hope to those suffering from chronic pain and other debilitating conditions. However, this hope is frequently dimmed by the stark reality of inconsistent supply, leaving patients in a precarious limbo. This blog delves into the profound disappointment and pain felt by patients due to these supply issues, and examines the wider repercussions for legislative progress in the realm of prescription cannabis within the UK.**

#### The Emotional Toll of Inconsistent Supply

**For many patients, prescription cannabis is not a luxury; it’s a lifeline. The emotional toll of the supply’s inconsistency is profound. Imagine planning your life around a medication that can vanish from the pharmacy shelves without warning. Patients like Sarah (a pseudonym to protect privacy), who suffers from multiple sclerosis, describes the situation as “living on a seesaw,” where her ability to manage pain and maintain a semblance of normalcy is constantly in flux.**

**This inconsistency breeds not just disappointment but severe anxiety. Patients are left wondering not if, but when their supply will run out, forcing them into a cycle of stress that can exacerbate their conditions. Families watch helplessly as their loved ones grapple with the uncertainty, creating an additional emotional strain on already burdened households.**

#### Physical Consequences of Supply Disruptions

**The interruption in supply doesn’t just disrupt lives emotionally; it has tangible physical repercussions. When patients are forced to abruptly stop their cannabis-based treatments, the consequences can be dire. The return of chronic pain, the resurgence of seizures, and the increased intensity of symptoms can push patients back to square one, negating months or even years of progress.**

**Healthcare professionals, too, are caught in this dilemma. Doctors and nurses, who have seen the benefits of consistent treatment, find themselves unable to promise stability to their patients. Dr. Richardson, a pain specialist, highlights the frustration of “knowing what could help my patients, yet being powerless to assure them of continuous treatment.”**

#### Legislative Stagnation: A Barrier to Progress

**The journey of prescription cannabis in the UK is mired in legislative caution, a reflection of the complex global stance on cannabis. Despite evidence of its benefits, the inconsistency in supply has given lawmakers pause, slowing the momentum for further legalization and integration into the healthcare system. Critics argue that these supply issues serve as ammunition for opponents of prescription cannabis, complicating efforts to present it as a reliable and effective treatment option.**

**The impact of these supply inconsistencies extends beyond patient care; they shape the narrative around cannabis legislation. Lawmakers, faced with the challenge of ensuring a steady supply, may become hesitant to expand access, fearing the backlash from potential shortages. This hesitancy feeds into a vicious cycle, where legislative progress is stalled, further entrenching supply issues.**

#### The Ripple Effect on Healthcare and Society

**The ramifications of inconsistent cannabis supply ripple through the healthcare system and society. Healthcare providers, tasked with managing patient expectations and treatment plans, often find themselves at the mercy of supply chains they can’t control. This unpredictability can undermine the patient-provider trust relationship, crucial for effective care.**

**Moreover, societal perceptions of cannabis as a legitimate medical treatment are influenced by these supply issues. Public confidence in cannabis as a medical solution wanes with each report of shortages, affecting societal acceptance and potentially delaying wider recognition and use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes.**

**The economic impact is also significant. Patients, many of whom already face financial challenges due to their health conditions, may incur additional costs seeking alternative treatments. Healthcare providers, for their part, must navigate the administrative and financial burdens of managing an unreliable medication supply.**

#### Towards a Solution: Pathways and Possibilities

**Addressing the inconsistency in prescription cannabis supply requires a multifaceted approach. Firstly, regulatory changes could ease some of the barriers to a steady supply, such as restrictions on importation and cultivation. Developing domestic production capabilities is another avenue, potentially reducing reliance on international sources and making supply chains more resilient.**

**Advocacy plays a crucial role. Patient voices and their stories of how cannabis has transformed their lives are powerful tools in shaping public opinion and legislative action. By bringing these stories to the forefront, there’s an opportunity to influence policy and create a more supportive environment for prescription cannabis.**

**A collaborative effort among stakeholders—government bodies, healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, and the cannabis industry—is essential. Together, they can work towards creating a reliable, effective, and accessible prescription cannabis system in the UK.**

#### Conclusion

**The path to integrating prescription cannabis into the UK’s healthcare system is fraught with challenges, not least of which is the inconsistency in supply. This issue not only affects patients directly, causing disappointment and physical suffering, but also hampers legislative progress and has broader implications for healthcare and society. However, by acknowledging these challenges and working collaboratively towards solutions, there’s hope for a future where prescription cannabis is accessible to all who need it, marking a significant step forward in patient care and treatment options.**

At one point, I was fully convinced that reptiles were secretly running the world, and their advanced capabilities made them untouchable. It felt like they were messing with my mind, but I eventually realized I might be showing signs of schizophrenia. Despite the crazy thoughts, I knew I didn't have to buy into them completely. I grounded myself and took control of the wild theories.

I've seen countless shape-shifting videos that just make you think, and I noticed all the low vibrational people that dumb it down instantly. Like, hello? So every single reptilian video is supposed to be a glitch? I was like, ""That's weird."" One day, I did a search filter and found a video posted the same day. It was a guy talking over a compilation of reptiles and their eyes flickering. The video was strange because I couldn't find it elsewhere. It was sort of funny; he had Tourette's, I'm sure, and he was swearing and acting like a crazy, manic man, screaming, ""They're real f\*\*king reptile f\*\*ks!"" I was in hysterics of laughter because of his reaction. But something interesting was his stutters of words saying, ""They're f\*kn real, just look at those f\*ks!"" I got you, reptile f\*ks. It was interesting because it was a lot of celebs in interviews, and I grew up with friends with Tourette's, and I know they just spit mostly their thoughts. I was like, ""This dude is onto something here.""

So I did more research about celebs and found some Justin Bieber clip of him shifting at a police interview. I remember watching like, ""Oh, I remember seeing this years ago!"" Like it was a psyops, the entire Justin Bieber was arrested drama. I'm like, ""Hmm, what is it, psyops?"" And this, so I'm like, ""Let's try connecting these dots."" Then there's Adele's supposed article that got taken/wiped from the web. People talking about seeing it, but over the years, it was mostly forgotten about. But apparently, she shifted at her concert backstage, and no one cared really because they thought she was in a costume. But what I found eerie about the article is she supposed she said to her fans who seen her like a lizard, ""Don't worry, I'm one of the good ones."" So I'm like, ""Why is the website now on the info got a big stamp with FALSE written like you needed to know that specifically?"" Just like the crazy teacher from Incredibles film goes, ""Coincidence? I think not!"" Was my brain at that point. After that, I just learned about the reptilians thanks to lots of smart people discussing on here and the obvious low-level toxic mind games people attempt to dismiss the entire subject as very noticeable, like they are in on it, but that was likely bots or people just with no intellectual thoughts so trolls basically. 

Currently, though, I see the UK government being run by the most obvious reptile, Rishi Sunak, the big annoying psyops that feeds on your soul, as in mental energy, same with US President Biden that is obviously a clone or something is odd with that dude anyway. I heard Biden died, and his brother took his spot, but that's a different conspiracy that goes mad. I'm just spitballing now; Kanye West feels like a psyops, especially after he went missing and mentioned they controlled him before he went missing. The royals are the most obvious too; you just can't miss that psyops, and I believe they got Diana as they knew it would be a feast of energy they feed on, but hey, that's just a theory! A reptile theory!"

Many people are assuming he'll be more active here than at PBC. The key name at 147 appears to be Conor Benn, who likely can't fight in the UK - thus needs a big US name (Hearn may also see this as cashing out, with Boots having a higher ceiling). 

However, we also know that Devin Haney rehydrated to like 165lbs for his 140lb fight against Regis Prograis. Devin is fighting Garcia, and may someday fight Lopez and Matias, but after that... Could he move up to 147 sooner than expected?

Haney-Ennis would be one the highest level US fights that Matchroom has ever promoted. I'm curious if Matchroom could end up in a similar spot to what PBC had in 147, with Spence, Porter, Ugas & Garcia. 

What do you think?"
2024-04-11 14:57:52,Friend forgot their railcard for a train almost a year ago. Now expected to pay £550 in five days with zero prior notice.,1,1c1h6yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1c1h6yj/friend_forgot_their_railcard_for_a_train_almost_a/,3,1712847472.0,"Never thought I'd be posting in a place like this but I'm so pissed off for my friend right now and need as much information I can get on this to help, because this doesn't seem right at all.

As the title says, they paid for their ticket (I think Trans-Pennine) under a railcard which they couldn't present, a small journey which would've only skived them out of £5. (I know this isn't the rules for a penalty fare, but they have email proof of owning one). Conductor asked them for their details and could only remember him saying the rail would 'contact them and sort something out'. They never got anything back from them. No letter, no 21 day reminder email, nothing. 

In the situation of my friend who has hardship funds in place of the uni they're studying at, it would be pretty fair for them to assume the rail's let them off since they've been silent about it. Additionally, they are registered disabled. Ten months later they get a Magistrate's court fine in the post from Marston, asking them to pay £550 in five days, or face the usual baliff bollocks where they start confiscating. From what I've heard from my friend, citizens advice and Marston's said there's nothing they can do to cancel, or even lower the fine (even though it was due to a LOT of negligence on their part), and the absolute best they get is to have to set up a payment plan to pay the entire thing over 12 months. 

This fine goes so far against their policy on treating people in situations like my friend's, according to this page: [https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/](https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/) \- specifically the parts about a fine this large having a strong financial impact on them (their family lives on the poverty line), and the fact that they are given only five days to pay it.

This whole thing sounds incredibly predatory and mishandled and I feel like there must be something more to investigate about this. I know there's a lot of ambiguity in proving that no contact was sent prior, but supposing that there absolutely wasn't anything, what would be the outcome from there? 

Please lmk if there's anything else important to note because I am trying to keep this as anonymous as possible out of respect for my friend, who is naturally pretty fucking terrified right now.  TY"

I (26 M) am moving to the UK end of April from Spain. I have some money that I would like to start investing as well as an X amount per month as soon as the moving is done. I have never invested before and I am a bit lost of how moving countries could impact it. So let me bullet point my questions to make it easier:

- Can I start investing while in Spain and then continue in UK? Do brokers usually allow this or would I have to sell everything and buy again?
- A friend of mine who also lived in the UK told me that what he did is having his address still in Spain while living there, so he was technically investing from here. This was before Brexit. Is this legal and recommended? I thought having the visa and working there invalidates my current living address in Spain
- I do plan to stay in UK couple years and then most likely move around Europe until, at some point, going back to Spain (but who knows, maybe I stay in UK my whole live). Considering this, are ISAs still a valid approach? They have good tax benefits but if I retrieve the money while in another country I would get taxed normally and I could not keep adding money there. It seems that if I move, start an ISA and then in two years I leave I would have to sell stocks and buy them again, which sounds bad… (?). 
- Having all this in mind, what broker would you use? People have recommended me Vanguard, Fidelity, MyInvestor and even some banks. My plan is 95% index funds and maybe couple stocks just to try

Thanks guys! Appreciate your help"

It's supposed to be a review on how the uk handles trans kids and adolescence in light of the recent Bell v Tavistock case. The problem is Dr Hilary Cass has a clear prejudice that she pours into her work and gets approval from other abhorrent people such as the PM Rishi Sunak or JK Rowling. The biggest fear I have with it is that its already making a difference, there are already calls for several NHS GIC's to close and reevaluate how they interact with patient care for trans youths. Its genuinely concerning because it doesn't just pick out trams children, but now anyone under 25. We're slipping down this hill straight into the jaws of a genocide and it's terrorfying.

When reading the review, it paints itself put to be a review designed to protect kids. It then goes on to say we don't know enough about puberty blockers to deem them safe (despite the fact that we do and still perscribe them to cis kids). Like it straight up ignores 50 years of reaserch on something that has been proven safe and is still administerd other children in a similar vein. It goes on to talk about how the human brain isn't fully developed until you're 25, so we should make the system harder for people under 25 to prevent any mistakes. Like this just blatantly ignores the fact that medical gac has one of the lowest regret rates out there and is extremely successful.

It says to look for external factors like ADHD or Autism, like either of thoes would change the gender incongruence?? Like yeah, lots of trans people are neurdivergent, but that changes nothing since u can't ""cure"" neurdivergence and gac is still proven to work ridiculously well in helping trans people, regardless of neurological wiring. Then it claims that, because of bullying and transphobia, kids should be discouraged from socially transitioning. ""Hey kids, are you sick of being bullied?? Well why don't you change your name and build a new life for yourself!"" Like are you seriously gonna victim blame on an actual medical report like it isn't people like YOU (Dr Hilary Cass) who encourage that bullying and transphobia!

Even ignoring all of that, it still takes seriously concerns that pretty much all major Western medical organisations know to be false. Like the idea that trans kids don't exist. The document that is supposed to be helping trans kids, humouring the idea that they don't exist. It's such a translucent exercise of cis-superiority that would be generous to imply arrogance and alleviate any malice intent from the equation. It gives a platform to bigots to stand on ""don't believe me, well in section 12:14 of the Cass Review it clearly states...(some dribble about social transitioning being wrong)."" I saw a tweet from a JK Rowling fan saying that the cast need to apologise to her for their remarks in support of the trans community and she responded (roughly) ""I wouldn't accept it."" THEY WERE RIGHT!! JK deserves no apology from anyone, but now she has a government approved document to validate her bigotry.

What scariest of all is how close we are to being a genuinely unsafe country for trans people. How many kids are gonna kill themselves because of this review? How many people are going to be assaulted and beaten up because of this document?? Last time rishi made a joke about trans people hate crime towards trans people took a significant rise in the UK, I dread to see what's gonna happen because of this. "

1. Is my understanding correct regarding the confirmation email?
2. Should I wait until the nearer my deadline in the hope of getting my Police Certificate early, or should I submit everything as soon as possible along with the confirmation email?
3. Will my currently uploaded documents be checked for validity before they're submitted?

Would also love to know about any swaps you guys would recommend. 

AM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

Then, I alternate between

2. NIOD GHKCU - Keen for a more potent version of this 

Or

3. Timeless 20% Vitamin C Ferulic Acid Vitamin C – When I used TO vitamin C powder at night I used to see a wee difference in my complextion when I woke up but with this I don’t so wondering if anyone can recommend something better that isnt TO- as I didnt like the texture and cba with the mixing.

4. La Roche Psay Invisible fluid - guess this is fine for now but would love to know of tinted sun creams that are good for pale, cool undertoned skin. 

 PM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

5. Dermatica tretinoin 0.015%/Niacinamide 4% Azelaic Acid 4% Every second night with 1 weeks break before and after microneedling 

On the nights I am not using Tret I use the 2. NIOD or 3. Timeless depending on what I used in the morning 

5. Dermatica ceramide and peptide moisturiser - keen to swap this out as it seems over priced for what it is 

Once a week or once every fortnight a TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution depending on microneedling healing stage 

Microneedle approx once a month following the Pen Smit protocol 

Concerns in order of priority:

Pinkish, purple under eye circles which are often puffy, particularly on the right side. I’ve had these for as long as I can remember and am almost accepting that blepharoplasty is probably the only intervention that will remove them. Until I can afford surgery ( I live I the UK) I really hope that microneedling and RLT help reduce them and think I should also look into whether underlying health issues or allergys could be contributing to them but find it quite overwhelming and not really sure where best to start, what tests to prioritse, how long I would have to exclude something or say, take allergy meds to know… Wow they really get me down like I look SO sick and I dream of feeling comfortable make up free. 

Redness under nose, like a pink moustache that isnt particularly textured beyond what you would expect from spots. Have had this for as long as I can remember, wonder if it is from blowing my nose in the cold frequently (used to skate) or from a steroid cream I v vaguely remember being prescribed something.

General uneven looking complexion – blotchy, spots take ages to fade and up close you can see that my skin is soooo congested, I have white heads, black heads, pustules pretty much everywhere apart from my jaw. Possibly mild rosacea type 2 which might be why I randomly got blepharitus which is now reacurring. Not figured that out yet, god so much is up! Though I came for product recommendations I am also wondering if there are there any Derms or aestheticians that would let me DM them some photos? I feel like I need to show my face in its entirety both up close and selfie distance in various lights to get a good idea of what my skin is like and some features I have are pretty identifiable and though the changes are slim I would be mortified if someone I know saw them.

&#x200B;

Anyway, back to the main reason I am posting - 

 I was considering these products linked below which are a bit out of budget and not easy to get hold of as I am not US based and got stuck on whether the added kojic acid and alpha arbutin in [Brightening Tranexamic Acid Treatment – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/multi-bright-tranexamic-acid-treatment-5?_pos=1&_sid=0bb9e1337&_ss=r) would be an issue with GHKCU and the Tret 

and then when I considered  [Tranexamic Acid Serum – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/tranexamic-topical-acid-5?_pos=2&_sid=8227fd551&_ss=r)  with the added kojic acid and niacinamide gathered that I couldnt use this with vitamin C but got stuck on whether it would be ok following GHKCU / Tret"

I am close to waiving the white flag. I'm not one to call on the Universe for signs, but it sure feels like I'm not meant for the UK.

* Applied: Feb 1
* Biometrics: Feb 6

* Email 2 for additional information: March 4
* Email 3 for additional information: March 18
* **Final decision refusal: March 28**
* Complaint submitted: April 2
* **Complaint not upheld: April 11**

**Refusal: ""***As above you did not respond to our emails requesting further information and you have not provided sufficient evidence that confirms the UK Ancestry link to your claimed grandparent.*""

**Birth Certificate:**

The letter states that I provided my ""Paternal Grandfathers death certificate."" 

I did not provide my grandfather's death certificate. The document is my father's birth certificate, whose middle name is my grandfather's first name. So I wondered if, at a quick glance, the assumption was that this document was of my grandfather. There is a deceased watermark on the document. I wonder if that, coupled with the similar names, resulted in a mixup. 

I will add that this document also clearly shows the names of my father's parents and has a large ""Birth Certificate"" title at the top. Not Death Certificate.

&#x200B;

**No Communication:**

In the emails asking for additional information, it was never mentioned that I provided my grandfather's death certificate. Only that they were not satisfied that I had provided enough evidence of an ancestral link. So, I assumed the original Birth Certificate was not sufficient. Thus, I gathered additional documents: **Act of Birth (long-form birth certificate),  Birth Certificate (original that I submitted), Baptismal Papers and my Grandparent's Marriage Certificate.**

The letter states that no communication was received in their attempts to follow up with me. This is untrue. I responded with the documents on the following dates:

**Email 1: March 1**

I sent an email to: [WorkNonSponsored.DocsRequested@fco.gov.uk](mailto:WorkNonSponsored.DocsRequested@fco.gov.uk) and received a confirmation auto-response of receipt.

**Email 2: March 24**

In response to an email stating that they still haven't heard from me, I replied to the email directly with the same information as provided on March 1. 

&#x200B;

**Complaint:** 

**April 2:** I submitted a complaint through the online form and directly to: [complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk](mailto:complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk)

The form did not allow me to provide an attachment, so I emailed with a very clear timeline, my documents, screenshots of my emails, and proof that they were received with the auto-email confirmation.

**April 11: Complaint not upheld**

Is my only option to apply for an administrative review? I do not have the option of waiting for a year. I also submitted my application before the new IHS increase, so re-applying means I will be paying a lot more. 

What I find frustrating is no one has addressed my points. All this complaint email reply confirms is that I've been refused. I feel like I am being forced to pay for a review. At this point, I would almost be happy if someone truly looked at my application and stated that they are rejecting me based on all of my evidence. 

Any advice or honest feedback, especially if there is a step where I've gone wrong, is appreciated. Feeling quite defeated..."

The problem is Dr Hilary Cass has a clear prejudice that she pours into her work and gets approval from other abhorrent people such as the PM Rishi Sunak or JK Rowling. The biggest fear I have with it is that its already making a difference, there are already calls for several NHS GIC's to close and reevaluate how they interact with patient care for trans youths. Its genuinely concerning because it doesn't just pick out trams children, but now anyone under 25. We're slipping down this hill straight into the jaws of a genocide and it's terrorfying.

When reading the review, it paints itself put to be a review designed to protect kids. It then goes on to say we don't know enough about puberty blockers to deem them safe (despite the fact that we do and still perscribe them to cis kids). Like it straight up ignores 50 years of reaserch on something that has been proven safe and is still administerd other children in a similar vein. It goes on to talk about how the human brain isn't fully developed until you're 25, so we should make the system harder for people under 25 to prevent any mistakes. Like this just blatantly ignores the fact that medical gac has one of the lowest regret rates out there and is extremely successful.

It says to look for external factors like ADHD or Autism, like either of thoes would change the gender incongruence?? Like yeah, lots of trans people are neurdivergent, but that changes nothing since u can't ""cure"" neurdivergence and gac is still proven to work ridiculously well in helping trans people, regardless of neurological wiring. Then it claims that, because of bullying and transphobia, kids should be discouraged from socially transitioning. ""Hey kids, are you sick of being bullied?? Well why don't you change your name and build a new life for yourself!"" Like are you seriously gonna victim blame on an actual medical report like it isn't people like YOU (Dr Hilary Cass) who encourage that bullying and transphobia!

Even ignoring all of that, it still takes seriously concerns that pretty much all major Western medical organisations know to be false. Like the idea that trans kids don't exist. The document that is supposed to be helping trans kids, humouring the idea that they don't exist. It's such a translucent exercise of cis-superiority that would be generous to imply arrogance and alleviate any malice intent from the equation. It gives a platform to bigots to stand on ""don't believe me, well in section 12:14 of the Cass Review it clearly states...(some dribble about social transitioning being wrong)."" I saw a tweet from a JK Rowling fan saying that the cast need to apologise to her for their remarks in support of the trans community and she responded (roughly) ""I wouldn't accept it."" THEY WERE RIGHT!! JK deserves no apology from anyone, but now she has a government approved document to validate her bigotry.

What scariest of all is how close we are to being a genuinely unsafe country for trans people. How many kids are gonna kill themselves because of this review? How many people are going to be assaulted and beaten up because of this document?? Last time rishi made a joke about trans people hate crime towards trans people took a significant rise in the UK, I dread to see what's gonna happen because of this. "

I have two tables:

Table 1: A list of all jobs and their locations (UK Postcodes). Table 2: A list of my consultants and their home addresses (UK Postcodes).

I've already created two map visuals. The visual on the left is made from Table 1, and the visual on the right is from Table 2. It's a report for operations management to assess whether we have enough cover for upcoming jobs next year or if we need to hire more consultants in certain areas with high demand for upcoming jobs.

 What I want to do is be able to click on a job on the left visual (Table 1) and then filter the right visual (Table 2) to show all consultants within a 100-mile radius. How do I achieve this?

I hope I've explained the problem clearly. If not, please feel free to ask any questions, and I would appreciate any feedback or help in the right direction.

I get not talking to the police in case you say something incriminating but to refuse to answer basic questions like ""do you understand?"" and ""are you ok?"" was very weird.

I originally took it to be Ruby taking Jodi/lawyers advice to the extreme however when watching a video on YouTube (for the life of me I cannot remember which one - there have been so many) that went into the timeline of what happened and where everyone was, something struck me. The video included all the 911 operators calls and how she coordinated it all. When they worked out who R's mother was, they said the only thing they had on file for her was a driving offense recently.

Whoever did the video then included the bodycam footage of that traffic stop and Ruby behaves in a similar way, barely speaking actually barely looking at the officer. 

Anyone shed any light on this behaviour? Or is this normal for people to behave in the US towards police officers? (I'm UK based)

Currently 19 and live in the UK but I have dual citizenship with lots of family across many states in the US I could live with temporarily while I got on my feet. 

But overall, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd assume the work is similar / the same and pays relatively similar. I'd also really appreciate some insight on positives and negatives of this trade in the US as where I am in the UK it has felt like 70% of the day is spent in the van between jobs in traffic especially on maintenance & repair side of things, which is something I wouldn't miss if it's any different in the US. 

I would appreciate any advice on what to do and anything I should avoid taking this career path. Thanks :)"

2024-04-11 15:25:30,Rebooking Drew McIntyre's WWE Championship Reigns (Part 3:Second Reign),1,1c1hv8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybooking/comments/1c1hv8h/rebooking_drew_mcintyres_wwe_championship_reigns/,0,1712849130.0,"After his victory against AJ Styles at Wrestlemania 37, Drew McIntyre looks to move on from his feuds with established stars, looking to showcase rising talent in his reign. However, his first challenge is from a former WWE Champion, Sheamus, who doesn't win the United States Championship in this universe. After winning the Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal at Wrestlemania, Sheamus wins a fatal four-way also involving Bobby Lashley, Braun Strowman and The Miz. Instead of getting too directly involved with McIntyre, Sheamus focuses on winning matches and proving himself as a viable challenger. During these matches, McIntyre seems to be scouting Sheamus, going on commentary and watching at ringside. At Backlash, the two men beat the piss out of each other. At one point, Drew McIntyre breaks Sheamus' nose with an elbow. The ending comes when the champion reverses White Noise into a Future Shock, and hits a Claymore for the victory.

In between Backlash and Hell In A Cell, Drew McIntyre has 2 championship defenses in NXT and NXT UK, against Tommaso Ciampa and Ilja Dragunov, further cementing his intent on showing off younger stars. He obviously retains both times, yet comes very close to losing both times. Ciampa gets a near-fall with an Air Raid Siren off the top rope, while Dragunov gets a near fall with a H-Bomb and the Torpedo Moscow.

On Raw, Drew McIntyre has begun a feud with Aleister Black, who has been undefeated since turning heel in November. He beats Kevin Owens in a #1 contenders match, and plays mind games with McIntyre in the build, even threatening his family. At Hell In A Cell, it is again a match where both men beat the piss out of each other. Both men are continuing to brawl, when Black goes for the Black Mass, which McIntyre ducks and hits the Claymore. The champion goes for the cover and Black somehow kicks out. The challenger gets on his knees, wanting McIntyre to hit another Claymore. He does it, goes for the cover, and wins. 

Going into Money In The Bank, McIntyre returns to his feud with The Club, now with Finn Balor who has returned from NXT. Despite this, Kevin Owens becomes #1 contender for the WWE Championship by defeating Styles clean, planting the seeds for The Club's break-up. In the build, Owens and McIntyre have to form an uneasy alliance to battle The Club, who keep meddling in their affairs. At Money In The Bank, The Club continue to get involved, at one point inadvertantly helping Kevin Owens stay in the match by putting his foot on the rope after the champion goes for the cover after a Claymore. Towards the end of the match, The Club attempt to get involved physically, yet Owens and McIntyre fight them off. When they finally clear them, the challenger goes for the Stunner when the champion's back is turned, yet McIntyre pushes him off and hits a Claymore for the victory. After the match, The Club attack both men, and Finn Balor holds up the WWE Championship, with AJ Styles looking on in envy.

Towards Summerslam, Drew McIntyre is caught up in the ongoing civil war within The Club. A 16-man #1 contenders tournament is made for the night after Money In The Bank to determine the WWE Championship challenger. AJ Styles beats Bobby Lashley and Finn Balor beats Kofi Kingston to make a Club final. In the final, Luke Gallows immediately punch both men at the same time, leading to a no-contest. After the match, Finn Balor states that it was their plan all along to get to the final and make it a no-contest, leading to a triple threat match being made for Summerslam. The following week on Raw, Drew McIntyre defeats AJ Styles in a rematch from Wrestlemania after Finn Balor accidentally costs his friend the match. Finn Balor attempts to help Styles up after the match, yet is shoved to the ground. The following week, Finn Balor defeats Drew McIntyre. On the go-home show, Balor and Styles, who are still not on great terms, battle against Drew McIntyre and a mystery partner. This mystery partner turns out to be Jinder Mahal, partly reuniting 3MB. McIntyre and Mahal win after Finn Balor accidentally hits Styles with a Shotgun Dropkick, leading to McIntyre hitting Styles with a Claymore to pin him and get the win. At Summerslam, Balor and Styles attempt to get along and take out McIntyre, and it works originally when they put him through the announce table with a Phenomenal Forearm. Inevitably however, it falls apart, and the men battle it out for 10 minutes. After a Double Clothesline, both men are down, and McIntyre regains the advantage. He is about to win the match with a Claymore, yet Gallows and Anderson come out and attack the champion. Styles and Balor join in, and after a 1916 on a chair, McIntyre is rendered out of the match completely. After this, it looks like the two challengers are going to be able to finish their battle. However, Gallows, Anderson and Balor turn to Styles, and beat the shit out of him. Gallows and Anderson hit the Magic Killer, and Balor hits two Coup De Grace's to win the match and the WWE Championship, turning on his best friend."

So far I've:
- washed the plant in the shower with plain water (preserving the soil because I don't have any to replace it with)
- I trimmed away (or pulled out) the brown crunchy dried leaves and stems
- with advice I made a dish soap, isopropyl alcohol and water mix in a spray bottle that I doused my plant with for a few days then did it less regularly like once a week ish because I was scared
- recently I put dish soap on a tissue and gave the leaves wipe to remove the white flakes I found on the leaves and the grown brown scales on others

When I got the plant, after trimming the green leaves were almost fully green but some of the tips of the leaves had browned and dried out. I'm noticing now that some of the previously fully green leaves are losing their green pigment and turning brown throughout. In fact, I'm noticing one of the new leaves that hasn't fully unfurled is turning brown too which is why I'm scared.

This is my first plant and I don't know what to do. I'm based in the UK for reference - I'd love some help on what this looks like to you and if you think I can save it please 🙏🏼 I'm hoping there's an ""easy"" way to save it.

Thank you xo
PS: there's one weird bunched up leaf in the last picture. It's been a few weeks and it hasn't opened up like some of the other new leaves. I'm thinking to cut it off? Thoughts?"
2024-04-11 15:24:41,Wake-On-Lan your SteamDeck: a full guide and caveats,1,1c1hujf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1c1hujf/wakeonlan_your_steamdeck_a_full_guide_and_caveats/,0,1712849081.0,"Recently I have been trying to get wake-on-lan (WOL) working on my LCD steamdeck with JSAUX dock. There has been many issues I have encountered, so I decided to summarize here so others can benefit.

**Why:**
* I want to play my steam library on my phone through steam link.


**Limitations:**

* You need a dock with Ethernet capability. Mine is [JSAUX 6-in-1 docking station](https://jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck).
* Easier to work with local network. If you want to do WOL over the internet, you need to setup port forwarding yourself, or configure a VPN (such as tailscale) to redirect your connection to one of your active computer/server in your home
* Steam is not officially supporting this feature. So it might break on future update.
* Do it at your own risk. Although everything I do is relatively safe, do not run commands from internet if you dont know what it will does to your system. 

&#x200B;

**How to:**

1. Unlock the readonly mode and make a sudo account. Please refer to other guides to do so. To confirm, try to install the packages we will need for checking later.

&#8203;

    $ sudo pacman -S gnu-netcat 

2. Get the ethernet *interface,* IP address, *MAC address,* and *broadcast address.* In the example below, *enp4s0f3u1u4* is the interface, and 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx is my MAC address, 163.xxx.xxx.xx is my IP address, and 163.xxx.xxx.255 is my broadcast address

&#8203;

    $ ip a
    5: enp4sxxxxxx: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 163.xxx.xxx.xx/xx brd 163.xxx.xxx.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp4s0f3u1u4

3. Enable the WOL feature of your network card. After querying ethtool interface, if Wake-on is ""d"", it means the feature is currently disabled. Then you need to set the value to ""g"". To make the changes persistent, please refer to the [archwiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wake-on-LAN).

&#8203;

    $ sudo ethtool enp4sxxxxxx | grep Wake-on
    
    Supports Wake-on: pumbag
    Wake-on: d
    
    $ sudo ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g

4. For the purpose of debugging, you can stop the firewall. It is not necessary for the WOL to works though. 

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl stop firewalld

5. Install a wake-on-lan application on your mobile phone, such as [this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.mrwebb.wakeonlan&hl=en&gl=US). Configure the MAC address, broadcast address, and IP address appropriately, and set WOL port to 9.
6. On your steamdeck, make sure firewall is disabled, and try to run the following command. While the command is running, try to press the send the WOL magic packet from your phone. If it works properly, then you will see some output on your steamdeck.

&#8203;

    $ sudo nc --udp --listen --local-port=9 --hexdump
    
    �������Lh��Lh��Lh��Lh����Lh��Lh�.... Received 102 bytes from the socket
    00000000  FF FF FF FF  FF FF 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  ........Lh....Lh
    00000010  17 E3 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  17 E3 00 E0  ....Lh....Lh....
    ...

7. If the previous part is working, congratulation, you can try to sleep your steamdeck and send the magic package from your phone to wake it up. Now you can reenable your firewall

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld

8. But, you might notice that, after the deck is sleeping for >15s, it will no longer wake up the deck. It leads to the second part to modify the ethernet power management. 
9. First, we need to find the appropriate usb devices for our ethernet. To do so, run lsusb. Try to list down all the ID for the Ethernet adapter, in my case, it's all the devices that starts with Realtek semiconductor, i.e. ""0bda:8153"", ""0bda:0411"", ""0bda:5411""

&#8203;

    $ sudo lsusb
    
    Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 003 Device 003: ID 13d3:3553 IMC Networks Bluetooth Radio
    Bus 003 Device 002: ID 28de:1205 Valve Software Steam Controller
    Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 0bda:8153 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8153 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter
    Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0bda:0411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. Hub
    Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 001 Device 004: ID 3434:0311 Keychron Keychron V1
    Bus 001 Device 003: ID 17ef:60e4 Lenovo Lenovo Legion M300 RGB Gaming Mouse
    Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0bda:5411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTS5411 Hub
    Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

10. The previous ID format is given as ""idVendor:idProduct"". We now need to find the appropriate driver for the those three usb devices. Run the following two commands, and pinpoint which usb devices corresponds to the IDs. 

&#8203;

    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idVendor
    ...
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/idVendor <==
    0bda
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/idVendor <==
    0bda
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/idVendor <==
    0bda
    ...
    
    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idProduct
    ...
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/idProduct <==
    5411
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/idProduct <==
    8153
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/idProduct <==
    0411
    ,,,
    

1. Check and enable the power management for these devices.  

&#8203;

    ## change the paths appropriately
    
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup
    disabled
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup
    enabled
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup
    disabled
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup""
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup""
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup""

11. Test to see if the WOL is working fine now. 
12. If it's working fine, you can make the changes persistent by writing a systemd service, as follows. Also after testing, turns out I dont need to enable ""1-1"" to make WOL work reliably.

&#8203;

    /etc/systemd/system/wol.service
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    [Unit]
    Description=Enable WOL usb
    Wants=network-pre.target
    After=network-pre.target NetworkManager.service
    
    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g ; sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup"" ; sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup""
    Restart=on-failure
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

13. Also, enable the unit.

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl enable wol.service

14. Profit! Enjoy your game by streaming to your deck from your mobile phone through Steam Link.

&#x200B;

**Caveats and TODOs:**

1. Only deck built in screen is turned on when turning on through WOL. If you have any suggestion how to turn on both displays, please let me know.
2. Haven't fully tested the systemd service yet."
2024-04-11 15:24:11,Ungrateful but I feel guilty if I stop doing what I should,1,1c1hu6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1c1hu6c/ungrateful_but_i_feel_guilty_if_i_stop_doing_what/,0,1712849051.0,"I have a narcissistic mom in her early 60's and I'm the youngest between me and my sister who is over a decade older than me.(30F,40F). From I've been 14 I've been helping with my mom's healthcare because she is diabetic etc. In my 20's I would be there mostly as her caregiver in the hospital and at home, sometimes financially when we would have to go to the hospital for an emergency and be there as emotional support.

Idk what but the caring mother I knew changed into a manipulative narcissistic character.

I'd realize growing up I would be labelled as the black sheep even though I always assisted heavily around the house everyday, followed rules but had my own bit of individuality I would be passionate about(piercings) but I always did well in school. I went through a traumatic situation that affected my university years and she would throw it in my face and call me mad(mentally unstable) even when she knows I am telling the truth. 

One time I told her something that another family member said about her and to get out of it, the person lied and tried to accuse me of making it up or being mad. My mother also berated me with those insults and say I must be mad. Later on, she found information confirming that I was telling the truth and never apologized. 

She also has a friend from the UK she knows from her childhood that she only talks about my older sister with and her kids. She never mentions any updates about me or good things with me.

We live in a family home(30F) with other family members but I take care of her daily. In our neighbourhood when we have an argument she would be on the top of her lungs calling me mental and making it seem to others as if I suffer from mental health issues. Quite a few people in the neighbourhood know me and she has no qualms embarassing me. In the country I live there are severe negative connotations and stigma associated with mental health issues and alot of people who suffer from this disease are met with violence.

At this point, this is one of the things she constantly says on the top of her voice. Living in a neighbourhood where people can easily hear this and spread gossip, I believe she chooses to do this to me because no matter what I always come back and help her and speak to her. Whereby with my older sister, she couldnt do or say half of these things to her without significant repercussions or my sister deciding to not speak with her again or allow her to see her children. 

I hate toxicity and even though I have my flaws I hate that I have to be consistently berated, attacked and embarassed but feel guilty if I put my foot down and stop caring for her. I dont deserve this treatment and its crazy because everybody else sees her as a nice sweetheart but she has some terrible narcissistic traits that are hurtful. 

She throws rocks and hides her hands and no matter what I do for her, sacrifice for her... its never enough.

I put studying last, classes, things I have to do JUST so I can be able to care for her and give her the things she needs to be comfortable. I put myself 2nd or last but I seem to be the most hated.

I even get blamed for situations where I am the victim and didnt do anything to deserve it. 

So my question is, should I just move out and cut all ties or stay a little longer(by the end of the year) and let them know I will be moving out by then so they can arrange other plans?

My mental health is declining because of how I am being treated and I cannot continue to allow this anymore. I am deeply hurt and keep getting hurt in every corner of my life.

I left out alot of details but I have always been there with my mother through thick and thin and even though my older sister is in a better financial position than I at the moment I always try to do the best that I can.

I hope someone understands me at the very least. I'm not putting myself as this woe is me character ...I dont have any issues having my mother as the biggest priority in my life but shes very disrespectful and hurtful too many times and I dont think I can continue to take it.

I bought an unused tube of Melamet off Vinted and I started using it (just on the upper lip area) last year. I probably only used it consistently for 2 weeks in the evening, and I was really careful in the sunlight afterward (factor 50!) It faded this winter (I’m UK-based) but then I started using Glycolic Acid toner consistently to help with my hormonal acne. Whilst it helped a lot with the acne, it’s now made my hyperpigmentation worse! I’ve been reading all the risks about hydroquinone and I don’t want to use it again I( was stupid for even using it in the first place).

Do you think I’ve done any damage by using it for that brief period, and what safe alternatives are there to help minimise fade the tan-mustache?! "

Especially when you see new releases on Instagram and get excited but then see different prices on the app. £175 is roughly about $220. Comparing it to prices in the US ($150), it’s more than a 45% increase. I love KITH, but this seems a bit unfair."

What I'm looking for. A diverse, active and friendly club with keelboat sailing for me, and (eventually) dinghy instruction for my infant.

All the clubs I've found so far are either barely active, disorganised, on bits of the Hudson that don't look particularly fun to sail on or essentially social clubs.

The biggest in the area seems Nyack. But any others I should check out?

Myself and my partner are preparing our application for an Unmarried Partner Family Visa - and were hoping to get some advice from the community at large - after a vary underwhelming encounter with an immigration firm we were hoping to use - who doesn't seem to be up on the latest UKVI changes etc.   


I am originally from the US and have been in the UK for 3 years as of next week, on a student visa which expires in early May. My partner is a British citizen, and we have been together in a relationship for 2 years 1 month, and living together for 2 years.   


We have lived together at 2 different addresses within the UK and have an array of documents to prove this in each of our names, as well as joint documents.   


We also have some photos and letters of support from UK family and friends regarding our relationship - so I am not concerned about the relationship or cohabitation aspects of the application.   


The reason we have been seeking out professional advice in the first place, was that my partner was let go from his employer in Feb 2024, just as we were gearing up to start our application. He had been with that employer for nearly 2 years, making £75k and we have all of those payslips + bank statements.  


He found a new job shortly after being let go, at the same salary - but his start date at the new job is not until the 29th of April. We have the settlement agreement from the old employer, the offer letter from the new employer etc as well.   


My partner also receives PIP so this makes us exempt from meeting the standard requirement, and needing to show adequate maintenance instead.   


As far as I know, you can combine PIP + income to show this - and when combined with his salary in relation to our housing costs (rent and council tax) we more than meet adequate maintenance   


But I am not sure if or how the slight ""gap"" in payslips will impact us - or if it will, given we had ""income"" from the settlement agreement from the old employer and there is a new job offer on the table at the same salary level.   


I am not sure how to frame this in a cover letter, or what/how much financial documents to show - and after speaking to the basically useless immigration firm - I am now confused as to whether we can apply now - or need to wait for him to actually ""start"" the new job.   


 I have finished my degree and have the right to work full time on my current visa until it expires, as a student who has finished their degree - and I also have an offer letter for a job which I start soon and which will provide an additional amount of salary - if that is useful as well.   


At this point, other than knowing which financial documents to send, if we are still able to - as well as how or if this gap will impact us - I would rather handle this myself if at all possible - as all other aspects of the application are straight forward, and I like to be in control of matters like tis as well as aware of all correspondence - as opposed to letting someone who may do a bad job - try to do it for me.   


I would really appreciate any help or advice. Thanks so much!

The team also investigated whether flat-faced ‘brachycephalic’ breeds were associated with higher risk. Surprisingly, longer-nosed ‘dolichocephalic’ breeds showed four times the odds of sedative/anaesthetic-related death compared with medium-length nose dogs, whereas no additional risk was seen in flat-faced breeds.

They are somewhat collectible to me, but really don't have monetary value. The declared value on this package was £50. I am certain I saw this on the outside of the package when I received it and the shipper is confident that's what he notated as well. Fast forward a couple of weeks and I have now been sent a UPS bill for $416.97.

This, of course, is absolutely nuts. So I called the Customs Broker phone line, and they told me the declared value was showing as $2550. This makes no sense to me. I saw there is a dispute button, but I threw away the packaging weeks ago, so I really have no evidence to prove my case. Is there anyone specific I should contact or anything to do to prove this wrong or bring up in a dispute? It will only let me type 80 characters, which isn't even enough for a full sentence."

I am a beginner tinwhistle player but advanced enough so that I started feeling limitations of the cheapest whistles: I've got a Feadog in D but the higher half of the higher octave is so unreliable and poor (too airy) sounding that it often limits me in playing.
I've found a guy who has four used whistles to sell, all in nice condition and reasonable prices. All in D so I am trying to convince myself there is no reason (other than GAS) to buy more than one. Maybe two if there is a reasonable explanation (like totally different sound or something).  
The four models I am choosing between are:
- Tony Dixon DX004   (https://www.tonydixonmusic.co.uk/product/soprano-whistle-key-of-d-4/)  
- Tony Dixon DX204D   (https://reverb.com/uk/item/12021977-dixon-solid-brass-d-whistle-dx204d)  
- Killarney Nickel   (https://mcneelamusic.com/wind/killarney-nickel-d-whistle/)  
- Goldfinch   (https://goldfinch.eu/pl/whistles/flazolet-high-d-goldfinch/)  
  
Which one (or maybe more than one?) should I choose and why?  
What is important to me? Ease of playing as I am still on my learning curve. ;)  
I've looked for reviews and sound samples online but this didn't solve my problem: I like the sound of every one of them (and it's really hard to tell the true sound from YT videos) and I haven't found any obvious reason to choose one over other ones.  
Please help me, share your recommendations, things I should know or anything that can help me choose. ;)   
And please, don't tell me ""buy them all"". I am trying to fight GAS, not feed it!

The thing is, this started around July 2023, progressively getting worse. I'm constantly battling fatigue, headaches, slight blurry vision in my right eye, and get more pins & needles in my arms and legs than I used to. I drink plenty of water during the day, I hit enough calories but still this is happening. 

What concerns me is that I can't check for swollen lymph nodes in my arm pits, as I had chest masculinisation surgery in 2021 and have no feeling in my chest/armpit area at all. 

Before all this started, I had a lot of energy but now I struggle to do anything but sleep.

I've been on testosterone injections (prescribed) since the start of 2023, and get injected every 10 weeks by my doctor.

Thank you to all who have participated in the survey so far, your input has been a great help. Just doing a 2nd wave of promotion for the study to try an increase the sample size.

I'm a final year undergraduate student on a live production based course. I am conducting a study as part of my dissertation which is aimed towards live sound engineers and touches on the topic of sound restrictions.

If you would like to participate in the study please use the following link:

https://linktr.ee/jakedaysound

The aim is to identify some of the most influential effects that sound restrictions have on the performance of live sound engineers, both positive and negative, as well as get broad feedback on how engineers can work more effectively under said restrictions.

I am very thankful to anybody who participates in the study and would like you all to know that this would help me out a great deal.

If you have any questions about the study I will be happy to answer them at the following email address: jd1741@my.acm.ac.uk

2024-04-11 15:10:43,How does the cost of Huel H&S compare to the average UK diet and can you reach 2500 calories?,1,1c1hiia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huel/comments/1c1hiia/how_does_the_cost_of_huel_hs_compare_to_the/,0,1712848243.0,"So I've switched to Huel for a lot of meals as I'm a student and emergency responder. Huel seems fantastic to me because in my case the convenience is undeniably very helpful. Plus ADHD is the worst thing ever for meal planning and I like to be able to scale up/down my meals.

Huel is marketed as a meal replacement and a lot of people for drawn to it for losing weight. But in my case I need to gain a bit or maintain and I'm trying to hit the NHS 2500 calorie recommendation as that is roughly close to my baseline. The obvious solution is ""scoop more you idiot"" but the costs do seem to rise quite quickly. I might be wrong though as I am very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel.

Generally I make my own overnight oats and have them in the morning for breakfast plus a banana and tea which is about 547 kcal. Then lets have a hot & savory meal at lunch for 400 kcal, and then a hot and savory meal for dinner for another 400 kcal. I'll add on 120 kcal extra for the odd snack/tea. This totals at 1467 kcal so we're still 1033 kcal short of 2500. For those meals I'd need about 9 bags and it will cost around £167.40 (£2.65/meal) or £150.66 with student/NHS discount (£2.39/meal)

Some people have suggested using 3 scoops so we'll try that as well. 547 kcal for breakfast, 600 Huel H&S (Lunch), 600 Huel H&S (Dinner), and after adding on 120 kcal you get 1867 so still 633 kcal short of 2500. Going by my bad maths I'd need about 13 bags of Huel H&S at £223.20 (£3.98/meal) or £217.62 with student/NHS discount (£3.58/meal).

Then lets try add in one Huel Black drink per day at 400 kcal which totals at 2278 kcal (362 short of 2500). This would be about £298.80 (£3.16/meal) or £268.92 with student/NHS discount (£2.84/meal).

So assuming I haven't made any horrible errors in my maths £2.84/meal still is pretty damn good. £268.92 seems expensive but for a month of food it might not even be that bad (again very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel). I think what I might do is buy a 20kg bag of basmati rice and throw it in the rice cooker which should boost the calories much higher and cheaper which I can combine with the Huel meals. Or throw in some naan bread etc. Huel is still great and it's definitely better than my standard diet both in nutrition and cost regardless."

I'm Mazey-Jessica, a transgender woman and pre all ops, and I'm looking at SRS, however, I am still new to the whole operation scene, but want them so badly. My online group said here was a good place where i could put my questions. I am in the UK, so UK doctors/practices would be brilliant, as I'm going private for this. My online reseach brought up many terms that I couldnt understand and I kept getting lost rabbit holes of looking what words mean.  
My questions are:

1) What is the difference between all the different methods of SRS, I know there is vaginoplasty and vulvoplasty, but I don't know what is what, as I said, I don't know anything. 

2) Is there any risks that I should worry about in each method (anything goes here, can be from ones that are common, to ones that are rare, however please catagorize them)

3) How good is the functionality of each method (like Q2, please catogorize them)

4) After SRS when can I start doing everything again? Ie having sex, being able to swim in chlorinated water, showering ect ect.

5) Any clinic in the UK anyone that anyone reccomend with pricing ranges, that would be helpful."

They started blowing up sometimes last year, and people always say because people ""expressing themselves or finding themselves"" mate how is your past life ""you"" if its not your current life but a past life?? Like that logic itself contradicts itself as well. It's awfully weird how literally 99 percent of therians are stuff like a fox or a dog or a cat but never something like an microorganism or an centipede. If therians are valid why are most of them cats or foxes etc and there's like barely ever any centipedes or ants. Like a lot more centipedes and ants have been killed when compares to cats lmao.They speak about shifts but then you have to wonder to yourself if they are pretending / convinced themseleves or if they have another mental disorder. I wouldn't attack a therian or hurt them or whatnot but I just can't wrap my head around it. I've sat and done research on research but therians are just contradicting themselves.
Some therians say ""we dont believe we were animals in our past life we believe we are spiritually connected"" and some say ""we only believe we were animals in our past lives"" now what does your past life have to do with your current life?? You can't remember what you had for breakfast a week ago but remember a whole ass past life?? Man wtf

Now according to the ny post:

**""Other research, conducted by Helen Clegg of the UK's University of Northampton, suggests that some therians may have higher levels of schizotypy, or schizotypal personality disorder. STPD is a condition marked by intense discomfort with social interactions and personal relationships""**

The same people who are therians today hated on the weird human collie dude a few years ago??? 

Physical transformation is impossible now there's no evidence but that belief. If you were an animal in your past life and have shifts etc why don't you eat your family and eat your pets or some shit?? Lmao


They experience species dysphoria too which is linked to other mental illnesses.

Interesting how most therians have a mental illness or struggle with depression or anxiety (which is also linked with species dysphoria)

Can't you just link zoanthropy to therianthropy??

2024-04-11 15:05:48,Question for anyone who fenced before 1987 - Turning your back in the 1980s,3,1c1he6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fencing/comments/1c1he6o/question_for_anyone_who_fenced_before_1987/,0,1712847948.0,"I've gone on deep dive into the History of the turning your back rule. The earliest reference to turning your back not being allowed I could find was:

>There are a variety of other bad customs equally deserving of reprehension as becoming a genteel fencer; such, for example, as crying out after every thrust , and turning their back upon their adversary when too much or too closely pressed by him, either for the purpose of arresting his impetuosity or frustrating his design, or to get it decided whether or not his stance of which thrust was irregularly given, when he not been able to keep it off in the impulsion .

>Turning the back in this manner, either through imprudence or custom in a serious affair, is very justly condemned, for, could such a circumstance who might, be alleged in excuse for being wrongfully touched, if the fencer so turning his back were to receive a thrust owing to his having irregularly defended himself?

The Modern Art of Fencing 1822, pg 215-216:

https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Modern_Art_of_Fencing/d38w2eHuaVYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA216&printsec=frontcover

Which feels very similar to the idea that turning your back is unfair because it causes a halt.

So then I traced forward through various rulebooks. The AFLA rules from the late 1800s are all very sparse, and it's quite clear that they don't intend to cover all circumstances ([Roughly 20 rules in total](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1891.pdf)) so there's no mention of turning.

But then as I trace up through the [1940s rules](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1940.pdf), up to the [1970s](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1974.pdf), they all have something to this effect:

> In foil and sabre such movements as the displacement of the target, side-stepping, turns and half-turns, are permitted, but the reversal of positions on the strip is forbidden. Therefore, if the original positions are actually reversed, the contestants shall be placed back in the positions which they occupied at the moment the reversing movement was begun.

-AFLA Rules from 1940

Which explicitly allows turning, and makes no mention of turning causing a halt.


*Weirdly as an somewhat related aside - the 1950 rules seem to allow epee fencers to pass each other and keep fencing, and end up on opposite sides*

> *Reversing of Positions. EPEE.*

> *Movements which result in the reversal of the 88 original positions of the competitors are allowed on condition that they are executed without jostling the opponent. . The reversed position is secured if the reversal is more than half executed when the president of the jury gives the order "" Halt.""*

The earliest I example of turning causing a halt or a Yellow card is the 1987 USFA rules

https://imgur.com/a/5IVljMq

http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/USFA-Rules-1987-with-Operations-Manual.pdf

So the question is - what the fuck? Could you completely turn your back without penalty before 1987? or was it just one of those conventions that caused a halt and never was explicitly written down until the 1980s?"

Just wanted to provide a timeline of events to date:

\- Moved in 2020  
\- Tenancy expired years ago, on a rolling tenancy  
\- Deposit wasn't protected (Currently have a deposit not protected claim, [old thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bhukxh/used_a_no_win_no_fee_solicitor_for_deposit_not/))  
\- They gave us a section 21 notice and then withdrew it after we told them it's not valid. 

The property in question has been neglected by the landlord. It's had no gas safety certificate for years, boiler was replaced recently by landlord when the last gas safety failed (our lives were at risk from it according to the gas safety engineer due to products of combustion). House has mould everywhere. My mum had to call the police after being pushed hard by the landlord on one occasion (She's nearly 70 and has trouble walking as is), she was sympathetic decided not to pursue charges, we just don't allow landlord visits now unless it's for safety reasons (gas safety, etc). My mum does plan to move from here but I've told her to drag out the process until the local housing allowance is raised in 2025 hopefully, as my mum is disabled/doesn't work and rent is unaffordable in London at this point. 

I posted a thread about this back here:

**So fast forward to today, we've received a letter from the agency that the rent will increase from next month, are we fine to just ignore it and continue paying the same rent?** We did this before when they asked us previously, we just ignored it. It wasn't a Section 13 rent increase form, which I think it needs to be on, it's it's just a few lines of text on a piece of paper that they will increase it. We're happy for them to go through the Section 21 process but from what I understand they can never issue the Section 21 now since the deposit wasn't originally protected and since there's no gas safety cert?

I'm really into video games, especially sim racing, VR, emulated stuff, but everything really. From AAA titles to indie games, across most genres.

2024-04-11 15:02:29,High Cost of Inconsistency of Prescription Cannabis: Navigating the Challenges,1,1c1hb70,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1c1hb70/high_cost_of_inconsistency_of_prescription/,0,1712847749.0,"#### Introduction

**In recent years, the United Kingdom has taken tentative steps towards recognizing cannabis for its medicinal properties, offering a glimmer of hope to those suffering from chronic pain and other debilitating conditions. However, this hope is frequently dimmed by the stark reality of inconsistent supply, leaving patients in a precarious limbo. This blog delves into the profound disappointment and pain felt by patients due to these supply issues, and examines the wider repercussions for legislative progress in the realm of prescription cannabis within the UK.**

#### The Emotional Toll of Inconsistent Supply

**For many patients, prescription cannabis is not a luxury; it’s a lifeline. The emotional toll of the supply’s inconsistency is profound. Imagine planning your life around a medication that can vanish from the pharmacy shelves without warning. Patients like Sarah (a pseudonym to protect privacy), who suffers from multiple sclerosis, describes the situation as “living on a seesaw,” where her ability to manage pain and maintain a semblance of normalcy is constantly in flux.**

**This inconsistency breeds not just disappointment but severe anxiety. Patients are left wondering not if, but when their supply will run out, forcing them into a cycle of stress that can exacerbate their conditions. Families watch helplessly as their loved ones grapple with the uncertainty, creating an additional emotional strain on already burdened households.**

#### Physical Consequences of Supply Disruptions

**The interruption in supply doesn’t just disrupt lives emotionally; it has tangible physical repercussions. When patients are forced to abruptly stop their cannabis-based treatments, the consequences can be dire. The return of chronic pain, the resurgence of seizures, and the increased intensity of symptoms can push patients back to square one, negating months or even years of progress.**

**Healthcare professionals, too, are caught in this dilemma. Doctors and nurses, who have seen the benefits of consistent treatment, find themselves unable to promise stability to their patients. Dr. Richardson, a pain specialist, highlights the frustration of “knowing what could help my patients, yet being powerless to assure them of continuous treatment.”**

#### Legislative Stagnation: A Barrier to Progress

**The journey of prescription cannabis in the UK is mired in legislative caution, a reflection of the complex global stance on cannabis. Despite evidence of its benefits, the inconsistency in supply has given lawmakers pause, slowing the momentum for further legalization and integration into the healthcare system. Critics argue that these supply issues serve as ammunition for opponents of prescription cannabis, complicating efforts to present it as a reliable and effective treatment option.**

**The impact of these supply inconsistencies extends beyond patient care; they shape the narrative around cannabis legislation. Lawmakers, faced with the challenge of ensuring a steady supply, may become hesitant to expand access, fearing the backlash from potential shortages. This hesitancy feeds into a vicious cycle, where legislative progress is stalled, further entrenching supply issues.**

#### The Ripple Effect on Healthcare and Society

**The ramifications of inconsistent cannabis supply ripple through the healthcare system and society. Healthcare providers, tasked with managing patient expectations and treatment plans, often find themselves at the mercy of supply chains they can’t control. This unpredictability can undermine the patient-provider trust relationship, crucial for effective care.**

**Moreover, societal perceptions of cannabis as a legitimate medical treatment are influenced by these supply issues. Public confidence in cannabis as a medical solution wanes with each report of shortages, affecting societal acceptance and potentially delaying wider recognition and use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes.**

**The economic impact is also significant. Patients, many of whom already face financial challenges due to their health conditions, may incur additional costs seeking alternative treatments. Healthcare providers, for their part, must navigate the administrative and financial burdens of managing an unreliable medication supply.**

#### Towards a Solution: Pathways and Possibilities

**Addressing the inconsistency in prescription cannabis supply requires a multifaceted approach. Firstly, regulatory changes could ease some of the barriers to a steady supply, such as restrictions on importation and cultivation. Developing domestic production capabilities is another avenue, potentially reducing reliance on international sources and making supply chains more resilient.**

**Advocacy plays a crucial role. Patient voices and their stories of how cannabis has transformed their lives are powerful tools in shaping public opinion and legislative action. By bringing these stories to the forefront, there’s an opportunity to influence policy and create a more supportive environment for prescription cannabis.**

**A collaborative effort among stakeholders—government bodies, healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, and the cannabis industry—is essential. Together, they can work towards creating a reliable, effective, and accessible prescription cannabis system in the UK.**

#### Conclusion

**The path to integrating prescription cannabis into the UK’s healthcare system is fraught with challenges, not least of which is the inconsistency in supply. This issue not only affects patients directly, causing disappointment and physical suffering, but also hampers legislative progress and has broader implications for healthcare and society. However, by acknowledging these challenges and working collaboratively towards solutions, there’s hope for a future where prescription cannabis is accessible to all who need it, marking a significant step forward in patient care and treatment options.**

2024-04-11 15:00:49,"""Journey into Reptilian Conspiracy Theories""",1,1c1h9mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/reptilians/comments/1c1h9mr/journey_into_reptilian_conspiracy_theories/,1,1712847649.0,"I've had quite a journey with the whole reptilian conspiracy thing. At one point, I was fully convinced that reptiles were secretly running the world, and their advanced capabilities made them untouchable. It felt like they were messing with my mind, but I eventually realized I might be showing signs of schizophrenia. Despite the crazy thoughts, I knew I didn't have to buy into them completely. I grounded myself and took control of the wild theories.

I've seen countless shape-shifting videos that just make you think, and I noticed all the low vibrational people that dumb it down instantly. Like, hello? So every single reptilian video is supposed to be a glitch? I was like, ""That's weird."" One day, I did a search filter and found a video posted the same day. It was a guy talking over a compilation of reptiles and their eyes flickering. The video was strange because I couldn't find it elsewhere. It was sort of funny; he had Tourette's, I'm sure, and he was swearing and acting like a crazy, manic man, screaming, ""They're real f\*\*king reptile f\*\*ks!"" I was in hysterics of laughter because of his reaction. But something interesting was his stutters of words saying, ""They're f\*kn real, just look at those f\*ks!"" I got you, reptile f\*ks. It was interesting because it was a lot of celebs in interviews, and I grew up with friends with Tourette's, and I know they just spit mostly their thoughts. I was like, ""This dude is onto something here.""

So I did more research about celebs and found some Justin Bieber clip of him shifting at a police interview. I remember watching like, ""Oh, I remember seeing this years ago!"" Like it was a psyops, the entire Justin Bieber was arrested drama. I'm like, ""Hmm, what is it, psyops?"" And this, so I'm like, ""Let's try connecting these dots."" Then there's Adele's supposed article that got taken/wiped from the web. People talking about seeing it, but over the years, it was mostly forgotten about. But apparently, she shifted at her concert backstage, and no one cared really because they thought she was in a costume. But what I found eerie about the article is she supposed she said to her fans who seen her like a lizard, ""Don't worry, I'm one of the good ones."" So I'm like, ""Why is the website now on the info got a big stamp with FALSE written like you needed to know that specifically?"" Just like the crazy teacher from Incredibles film goes, ""Coincidence? I think not!"" Was my brain at that point. After that, I just learned about the reptilians thanks to lots of smart people discussing on here and the obvious low-level toxic mind games people attempt to dismiss the entire subject as very noticeable, like they are in on it, but that was likely bots or people just with no intellectual thoughts so trolls basically. 

Currently, though, I see the UK government being run by the most obvious reptile, Rishi Sunak, the big annoying psyops that feeds on your soul, as in mental energy, same with US President Biden that is obviously a clone or something is odd with that dude anyway. I heard Biden died, and his brother took his spot, but that's a different conspiracy that goes mad. I'm just spitballing now; Kanye West feels like a psyops, especially after he went missing and mentioned they controlled him before he went missing. The royals are the most obvious too; you just can't miss that psyops, and I believe they got Diana as they knew it would be a feast of energy they feed on, but hey, that's just a theory! A reptile theory!"

Many people are assuming he'll be more active here than at PBC. The key name at 147 appears to be Conor Benn, who likely can't fight in the UK - thus needs a big US name (Hearn may also see this as cashing out, with Boots having a higher ceiling). 

However, we also know that Devin Haney rehydrated to like 165lbs for his 140lb fight against Regis Prograis. Devin is fighting Garcia, and may someday fight Lopez and Matias, but after that... Could he move up to 147 sooner than expected?

Haney-Ennis would be one the highest level US fights that Matchroom has ever promoted. I'm curious if Matchroom could end up in a similar spot to what PBC had in 147, with Spence, Porter, Ugas & Garcia. 

What do you think?"
2024-04-11 14:57:52,Friend forgot their railcard for a train almost a year ago. Now expected to pay £550 in five days with zero prior notice.,1,1c1h6yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1c1h6yj/friend_forgot_their_railcard_for_a_train_almost_a/,3,1712847472.0,"Never thought I'd be posting in a place like this but I'm so pissed off for my friend right now and need as much information I can get on this to help, because this doesn't seem right at all.

As the title says, they paid for their ticket (I think Trans-Pennine) under a railcard which they couldn't present, a small journey which would've only skived them out of £5. (I know this isn't the rules for a penalty fare, but they have email proof of owning one). Conductor asked them for their details and could only remember him saying the rail would 'contact them and sort something out'. They never got anything back from them. No letter, no 21 day reminder email, nothing. 

In the situation of my friend who has hardship funds in place of the uni they're studying at, it would be pretty fair for them to assume the rail's let them off since they've been silent about it. Additionally, they are registered disabled. Ten months later they get a Magistrate's court fine in the post from Marston, asking them to pay £550 in five days, or face the usual baliff bollocks where they start confiscating. From what I've heard from my friend, citizens advice and Marston's said there's nothing they can do to cancel, or even lower the fine (even though it was due to a LOT of negligence on their part), and the absolute best they get is to have to set up a payment plan to pay the entire thing over 12 months. 

This fine goes so far against their policy on treating people in situations like my friend's, according to this page: [https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/](https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/) \- specifically the parts about a fine this large having a strong financial impact on them (their family lives on the poverty line), and the fact that they are given only five days to pay it.

This whole thing sounds incredibly predatory and mishandled and I feel like there must be something more to investigate about this. I know there's a lot of ambiguity in proving that no contact was sent prior, but supposing that there absolutely wasn't anything, what would be the outcome from there? 

Please lmk if there's anything else important to note because I am trying to keep this as anonymous as possible out of respect for my friend, who is naturally pretty fucking terrified right now.  TY"

I (26 M) am moving to the UK end of April from Spain. I have some money that I would like to start investing as well as an X amount per month as soon as the moving is done. I have never invested before and I am a bit lost of how moving countries could impact it. So let me bullet point my questions to make it easier:

- Can I start investing while in Spain and then continue in UK? Do brokers usually allow this or would I have to sell everything and buy again?
- A friend of mine who also lived in the UK told me that what he did is having his address still in Spain while living there, so he was technically investing from here. This was before Brexit. Is this legal and recommended? I thought having the visa and working there invalidates my current living address in Spain
- I do plan to stay in UK couple years and then most likely move around Europe until, at some point, going back to Spain (but who knows, maybe I stay in UK my whole live). Considering this, are ISAs still a valid approach? They have good tax benefits but if I retrieve the money while in another country I would get taxed normally and I could not keep adding money there. It seems that if I move, start an ISA and then in two years I leave I would have to sell stocks and buy them again, which sounds bad… (?). 
- Having all this in mind, what broker would you use? People have recommended me Vanguard, Fidelity, MyInvestor and even some banks. My plan is 95% index funds and maybe couple stocks just to try

Like it straight up ignores 50 years of reaserch on something that has been proven safe and is still administerd other children in a similar vein. It goes on to talk about how the human brain isn't fully developed until you're 25, so we should make the system harder for people under 25 to prevent any mistakes. Like this just blatantly ignores the fact that medical gac has one of the lowest regret rates out there and is extremely successful.

It says to look for external factors like ADHD or Autism, like either of thoes would change the gender incongruence?? Like yeah, lots of trans people are neurdivergent, but that changes nothing since u can't ""cure"" neurdivergence and gac is still proven to work ridiculously well in helping trans people, regardless of neurological wiring. Then it claims that, because of bullying and transphobia, kids should be discouraged from socially transitioning. ""Hey kids, are you sick of being bullied?? Well why don't you change your name and build a new life for yourself!"" Like are you seriously gonna victim blame on an actual medical report like it isn't people like YOU (Dr Hilary Cass) who encourage that bullying and transphobia!

Even ignoring all of that, it still takes seriously concerns that pretty much all major Western medical organisations know to be false. Like the idea that trans kids don't exist. The document that is supposed to be helping trans kids, humouring the idea that they don't exist. It's such a translucent exercise of cis-superiority that would be generous to imply arrogance and alleviate any malice intent from the equation. It gives a platform to bigots to stand on ""don't believe me, well in section 12:14 of the Cass Review it clearly states...(some dribble about social transitioning being wrong)."" I saw a tweet from a JK Rowling fan saying that the cast need to apologise to her for their remarks in support of the trans community and she responded (roughly) ""I wouldn't accept it."" THEY WERE RIGHT!! JK deserves no apology from anyone, but now she has a government approved document to validate her bigotry.

What scariest of all is how close we are to being a genuinely unsafe country for trans people. How many kids are gonna kill themselves because of this review? How many people are going to be assaulted and beaten up because of this document?? Last time rishi made a joke about trans people hate crime towards trans people took a significant rise in the UK, I dread to see what's gonna happen because of this. "

I am currently in the process of submitting my documents with a deadline of April 23rd. I have uploaded everything except for my Police Certificate which is not due to arrive until the day after my deadline.

I am under the impression that I can upload the confirmation email I received for the Police Certificate rather than the certificate itself and this will act as a substitute until my certificate arrives.

So I have a couple of questions:

1. Is my understanding correct regarding the confirmation email?
2. Should I wait until the nearer my deadline in the hope of getting my Police Certificate early, or should I submit everything as soon as possible along with the confirmation email?
3. Will my currently uploaded documents be checked for validity before they're submitted?

Thanks in advance!"

Would also love to know about any swaps you guys would recommend. 

AM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

Then, I alternate between

2. NIOD GHKCU - Keen for a more potent version of this 

Or

3. Timeless 20% Vitamin C Ferulic Acid Vitamin C – When I used TO vitamin C powder at night I used to see a wee difference in my complextion when I woke up but with this I don’t so wondering if anyone can recommend something better that isnt TO- as I didnt like the texture and cba with the mixing.

4. La Roche Psay Invisible fluid - guess this is fine for now but would love to know of tinted sun creams that are good for pale, cool undertoned skin. 

 PM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

5. Dermatica tretinoin 0.015%/Niacinamide 4% Azelaic Acid 4% Every second night with 1 weeks break before and after microneedling 

On the nights I am not using Tret I use the 2. NIOD or 3. Timeless depending on what I used in the morning 

5. Dermatica ceramide and peptide moisturiser - keen to swap this out as it seems over priced for what it is 

Once a week or once every fortnight a TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution depending on microneedling healing stage 

Microneedle approx once a month following the Pen Smit protocol 

Concerns in order of priority:

Pinkish, purple under eye circles which are often puffy, particularly on the right side. I’ve had these for as long as I can remember and am almost accepting that blepharoplasty is probably the only intervention that will remove them. Until I can afford surgery ( I live I the UK) I really hope that microneedling and RLT help reduce them and think I should also look into whether underlying health issues or allergys could be contributing to them but find it quite overwhelming and not really sure where best to start, what tests to prioritse, how long I would have to exclude something or say, take allergy meds to know… Wow they really get me down like I look SO sick and I dream of feeling comfortable make up free. 

Redness under nose, like a pink moustache that isnt particularly textured beyond what you would expect from spots. Have had this for as long as I can remember, wonder if it is from blowing my nose in the cold frequently (used to skate) or from a steroid cream I v vaguely remember being prescribed something.

General uneven looking complexion – blotchy, spots take ages to fade and up close you can see that my skin is soooo congested, I have white heads, black heads, pustules pretty much everywhere apart from my jaw. Possibly mild rosacea type 2 which might be why I randomly got blepharitus which is now reacurring. Not figured that out yet, god so much is up! Though I came for product recommendations I am also wondering if there are there any Derms or aestheticians that would let me DM them some photos? I feel like I need to show my face in its entirety both up close and selfie distance in various lights to get a good idea of what my skin is like and some features I have are pretty identifiable and though the changes are slim I would be mortified if someone I know saw them.

&#x200B;

Anyway, back to the main reason I am posting - 

 I was considering these products linked below which are a bit out of budget and not easy to get hold of as I am not US based and got stuck on whether the added kojic acid and alpha arbutin in [Brightening Tranexamic Acid Treatment – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/multi-bright-tranexamic-acid-treatment-5?_pos=1&_sid=0bb9e1337&_ss=r) would be an issue with GHKCU and the Tret 

and then when I considered  [Tranexamic Acid Serum – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/tranexamic-topical-acid-5?_pos=2&_sid=8227fd551&_ss=r)  with the added kojic acid and niacinamide gathered that I couldnt use this with vitamin C but got stuck on whether it would be ok following GHKCU / Tret"

I am close to waiving the white flag. I'm not one to call on the Universe for signs, but it sure feels like I'm not meant for the UK.

**Timeline:**

* Route: Ancestry Visa
* (Canadian) via my Paternal Grandparents
* Applied: Feb 1
* Biometrics: Feb 6
* Email 1 for additional information: Feb 19
* Email 2 for additional information: March 4
* Email 3 for additional information: March 18
* **Final decision refusal: March 28**
* Complaint submitted: April 2
* **Complaint not upheld: April 11**

**Refusal: ""***As above you did not respond to our emails requesting further information and you have not provided sufficient evidence that confirms the UK Ancestry link to your claimed grandparent.*""

**Birth Certificate:**

The letter states that I provided my ""Paternal Grandfathers death certificate."" 

I did not provide my grandfather's death certificate. The document is my father's birth certificate, whose middle name is my grandfather's first name. So I wondered if, at a quick glance, the assumption was that this document was of my grandfather. There is a deceased watermark on the document. I wonder if that, coupled with the similar names, resulted in a mixup. 

I will add that this document also clearly shows the names of my father's parents and has a large ""Birth Certificate"" title at the top. Not Death Certificate.

&#x200B;

**No Communication:**

In the emails asking for additional information, it was never mentioned that I provided my grandfather's death certificate. Only that they were not satisfied that I had provided enough evidence of an ancestral link. So, I assumed the original Birth Certificate was not sufficient. Thus, I gathered additional documents: **Act of Birth (long-form birth certificate),  Birth Certificate (original that I submitted), Baptismal Papers and my Grandparent's Marriage Certificate.**

The letter states that no communication was received in their attempts to follow up with me. This is untrue. I responded with the documents on the following dates:

**Email 1: March 1**

I sent an email to: [WorkNonSponsored.DocsRequested@fco.gov.uk](mailto:WorkNonSponsored.DocsRequested@fco.gov.uk) and received a confirmation auto-response of receipt.

**Email 2: March 24**

In response to an email stating that they still haven't heard from me, I replied to the email directly with the same information as provided on March 1. 

&#x200B;

**Complaint:** 

**April 2:** I submitted a complaint through the online form and directly to: [complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk](mailto:complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk)

The form did not allow me to provide an attachment, so I emailed with a very clear timeline, my documents, screenshots of my emails, and proof that they were received with the auto-email confirmation.

**April 11: Complaint not upheld**

Is my only option to apply for an administrative review? I do not have the option of waiting for a year. I also submitted my application before the new IHS increase, so re-applying means I will be paying a lot more. 

What I find frustrating is no one has addressed my points. All this complaint email reply confirms is that I've been refused. I feel like I am being forced to pay for a review. At this point, I would almost be happy if someone truly looked at my application and stated that they are rejecting me based on all of my evidence. 

Any advice or honest feedback, especially if there is a step where I've gone wrong, is appreciated. Feeling quite defeated..."

It's supposed to be a review on how the uk handles trans kids and adolescence in light of the recent Bell v Tavistock case. The problem is Dr Hilary Cass has a clear prejudice that she pours into her work and gets approval from other abhorrent people such as the PM Rishi Sunak or JK Rowling. The biggest fear I have with it is that its already making a difference, there are already calls for several NHS GIC's to close and reevaluate how they interact with patient care for trans youths. Its genuinely concerning because it doesn't just pick out trams children, but now anyone under 25. We're slipping down this hill straight into the jaws of a genocide and it's terrorfying.

I get not talking to the police in case you say something incriminating but to refuse to answer basic questions like ""do you understand?"" and ""are you ok?"" was very weird.

I originally took it to be Ruby taking Jodi/lawyers advice to the extreme however when watching a video on YouTube (for the life of me I cannot remember which one - there have been so many) that went into the timeline of what happened and where everyone was, something struck me. The video included all the 911 operators calls and how she coordinated it all. When they worked out who R's mother was, they said the only thing they had on file for her was a driving offense recently.

Whoever did the video then included the bodycam footage of that traffic stop and Ruby behaves in a similar way, barely speaking actually barely looking at the officer. 

Anyone shed any light on this behaviour? Or is this normal for people to behave in the US towards police officers? (I'm UK based)

However, his first challenge is from a former WWE Champion, Sheamus, who doesn't win the United States Championship in this universe. After winning the Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal at Wrestlemania, Sheamus wins a fatal four-way also involving Bobby Lashley, Braun Strowman and The Miz. Instead of getting too directly involved with McIntyre, Sheamus focuses on winning matches and proving himself as a viable challenger. During these matches, McIntyre seems to be scouting Sheamus, going on commentary and watching at ringside. At Backlash, the two men beat the piss out of each other. At one point, Drew McIntyre breaks Sheamus' nose with an elbow. The ending comes when the champion reverses White Noise into a Future Shock, and hits a Claymore for the victory.

In between Backlash and Hell In A Cell, Drew McIntyre has 2 championship defenses in NXT and NXT UK, against Tommaso Ciampa and Ilja Dragunov, further cementing his intent on showing off younger stars. He obviously retains both times, yet comes very close to losing both times. Ciampa gets a near-fall with an Air Raid Siren off the top rope, while Dragunov gets a near fall with a H-Bomb and the Torpedo Moscow.

On Raw, Drew McIntyre has begun a feud with Aleister Black, who has been undefeated since turning heel in November. He beats Kevin Owens in a #1 contenders match, and plays mind games with McIntyre in the build, even threatening his family. At Hell In A Cell, it is again a match where both men beat the piss out of each other. Both men are continuing to brawl, when Black goes for the Black Mass, which McIntyre ducks and hits the Claymore. The champion goes for the cover and Black somehow kicks out. The challenger gets on his knees, wanting McIntyre to hit another Claymore. He does it, goes for the cover, and wins. 

Going into Money In The Bank, McIntyre returns to his feud with The Club, now with Finn Balor who has returned from NXT. Despite this, Kevin Owens becomes #1 contender for the WWE Championship by defeating Styles clean, planting the seeds for The Club's break-up. In the build, Owens and McIntyre have to form an uneasy alliance to battle The Club, who keep meddling in their affairs. At Money In The Bank, The Club continue to get involved, at one point inadvertantly helping Kevin Owens stay in the match by putting his foot on the rope after the champion goes for the cover after a Claymore. Towards the end of the match, The Club attempt to get involved physically, yet Owens and McIntyre fight them off. When they finally clear them, the challenger goes for the Stunner when the champion's back is turned, yet McIntyre pushes him off and hits a Claymore for the victory. After the match, The Club attack both men, and Finn Balor holds up the WWE Championship, with AJ Styles looking on in envy.

Towards Summerslam, Drew McIntyre is caught up in the ongoing civil war within The Club. A 16-man #1 contenders tournament is made for the night after Money In The Bank to determine the WWE Championship challenger. AJ Styles beats Bobby Lashley and Finn Balor beats Kofi Kingston to make a Club final. In the final, Luke Gallows immediately punch both men at the same time, leading to a no-contest. After the match, Finn Balor states that it was their plan all along to get to the final and make it a no-contest, leading to a triple threat match being made for Summerslam. The following week on Raw, Drew McIntyre defeats AJ Styles in a rematch from Wrestlemania after Finn Balor accidentally costs his friend the match. Finn Balor attempts to help Styles up after the match, yet is shoved to the ground. The following week, Finn Balor defeats Drew McIntyre. On the go-home show, Balor and Styles, who are still not on great terms, battle against Drew McIntyre and a mystery partner. This mystery partner turns out to be Jinder Mahal, partly reuniting 3MB. McIntyre and Mahal win after Finn Balor accidentally hits Styles with a Shotgun Dropkick, leading to McIntyre hitting Styles with a Claymore to pin him and get the win. At Summerslam, Balor and Styles attempt to get along and take out McIntyre, and it works originally when they put him through the announce table with a Phenomenal Forearm. Inevitably however, it falls apart, and the men battle it out for 10 minutes. After a Double Clothesline, both men are down, and McIntyre regains the advantage. He is about to win the match with a Claymore, yet Gallows and Anderson come out and attack the champion. Styles and Balor join in, and after a 1916 on a chair, McIntyre is rendered out of the match completely. After this, it looks like the two challengers are going to be able to finish their battle. However, Gallows, Anderson and Balor turn to Styles, and beat the shit out of him.

2024-04-11 15:24:54,I think my areca palm is dying,1,1c1huq9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1c1huq9,0,1712849094.0,"Hi y'all! I'm new to the Reddit and I wanted advice about my first plant, the areca palm. I inherited it and after getting it I was told by a friend that it has a scale infestation.

So far I've:
- washed the plant in the shower with plain water (preserving the soil because I don't have any to replace it with)
- I trimmed away (or pulled out) the brown crunchy dried leaves and stems
- with advice I made a dish soap, isopropyl alcohol and water mix in a spray bottle that I doused my plant with for a few days then did it less regularly like once a week ish because I was scared
- recently I put dish soap on a tissue and gave the leaves wipe to remove the white flakes I found on the leaves and the grown brown scales on others

When I got the plant, after trimming the green leaves were almost fully green but some of the tips of the leaves had browned and dried out. I'm noticing now that some of the previously fully green leaves are losing their green pigment and turning brown throughout. In fact, I'm noticing one of the new leaves that hasn't fully unfurled is turning brown too which is why I'm scared.

This is my first plant and I don't know what to do. I'm based in the UK for reference - I'd love some help on what this looks like to you and if you think I can save it please 🙏🏼 I'm hoping there's an ""easy"" way to save it.

Thank you xo
PS: there's one weird bunched up leaf in the last picture. It's been a few weeks and it hasn't opened up like some of the other new leaves. I'm thinking to cut it off? Thoughts?"
2024-04-11 15:24:41,Wake-On-Lan your SteamDeck: a full guide and caveats,1,1c1hujf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1c1hujf/wakeonlan_your_steamdeck_a_full_guide_and_caveats/,0,1712849081.0,"Recently I have been trying to get wake-on-lan (WOL) working on my LCD steamdeck with JSAUX dock. There has been many issues I have encountered, so I decided to summarize here so others can benefit.

**Why:**
* I want to play my steam library on my phone through steam link.


**Limitations:**

* You need a dock with Ethernet capability. Mine is [JSAUX 6-in-1 docking station](https://jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck).
* Easier to work with local network. If you want to do WOL over the internet, you need to setup port forwarding yourself, or configure a VPN (such as tailscale) to redirect your connection to one of your active computer/server in your home
* Steam is not officially supporting this feature. So it might break on future update.
* Do it at your own risk. Although everything I do is relatively safe, do not run commands from internet if you dont know what it will does to your system. 

&#x200B;

**How to:**

1. Unlock the readonly mode and make a sudo account. Please refer to other guides to do so. To confirm, try to install the packages we will need for checking later.

&#8203;

    $ sudo pacman -S gnu-netcat 

2. Get the ethernet *interface,* IP address, *MAC address,* and *broadcast address.* In the example below, *enp4s0f3u1u4* is the interface, and 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx is my MAC address, 163.xxx.xxx.xx is my IP address, and 163.xxx.xxx.255 is my broadcast address

&#8203;

    $ ip a
    5: enp4sxxxxxx: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 163.xxx.xxx.xx/xx brd 163.xxx.xxx.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp4s0f3u1u4

3. Enable the WOL feature of your network card. After querying ethtool interface, if Wake-on is ""d"", it means the feature is currently disabled. Then you need to set the value to ""g"". To make the changes persistent, please refer to the [archwiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wake-on-LAN).

&#8203;

    $ sudo ethtool enp4sxxxxxx | grep Wake-on
    
    Supports Wake-on: pumbag
    Wake-on: d
    
    $ sudo ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g

4. For the purpose of debugging, you can stop the firewall. It is not necessary for the WOL to works though. 

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl stop firewalld

5. Install a wake-on-lan application on your mobile phone, such as [this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.mrwebb.wakeonlan&hl=en&gl=US). Configure the MAC address, broadcast address, and IP address appropriately, and set WOL port to 9.
6. On your steamdeck, make sure firewall is disabled, and try to run the following command. While the command is running, try to press the send the WOL magic packet from your phone. If it works properly, then you will see some output on your steamdeck.

&#8203;

    $ sudo nc --udp --listen --local-port=9 --hexdump
    
    �������Lh��Lh��Lh��Lh����Lh��Lh�.... Received 102 bytes from the socket
    00000000  FF FF FF FF  FF FF 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  ........Lh....Lh
    00000010  17 E3 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  17 E3 00 E0  ....Lh....Lh....
    ...

7. If the previous part is working, congratulation, you can try to sleep your steamdeck and send the magic package from your phone to wake it up. Now you can reenable your firewall

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld

8. But, you might notice that, after the deck is sleeping for >15s, it will no longer wake up the deck. It leads to the second part to modify the ethernet power management. 
9. First, we need to find the appropriate usb devices for our ethernet. To do so, run lsusb. Try to list down all the ID for the Ethernet adapter, in my case, it's all the devices that starts with Realtek semiconductor, i.e. ""0bda:8153"", ""0bda:0411"", ""0bda:5411""

&#8203;

    $ sudo lsusb
    
    Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 003 Device 003: ID 13d3:3553 IMC Networks Bluetooth Radio
    Bus 003 Device 002: ID 28de:1205 Valve Software Steam Controller
    Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 0bda:8153 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8153 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter
    Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0bda:0411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. Hub
    Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 001 Device 004: ID 3434:0311 Keychron Keychron V1
    Bus 001 Device 003: ID 17ef:60e4 Lenovo Lenovo Legion M300 RGB Gaming Mouse
    Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0bda:5411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTS5411 Hub
    Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

10. The previous ID format is given as ""idVendor:idProduct"". We now need to find the appropriate driver for the those three usb devices. Run the following two commands, and pinpoint which usb devices corresponds to the IDs. 

&#8203;

    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idVendor
    ...
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/idVendor <==
    0bda
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/idVendor <==
    0bda
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/idVendor <==
    0bda
    ...
    
    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idProduct
    ...
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/idProduct <==
    5411
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/idProduct <==
    8153
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/idProduct <==
    0411
    ,,,
    

1. Check and enable the power management for these devices.  

&#8203;

    ## change the paths appropriately
    
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup
    disabled
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup
    enabled
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup
    disabled
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup""
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup""
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup""

11. Test to see if the WOL is working fine now. 
12. If it's working fine, you can make the changes persistent by writing a systemd service, as follows. Also after testing, turns out I dont need to enable ""1-1"" to make WOL work reliably.

&#8203;

    /etc/systemd/system/wol.service
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    [Unit]
    Description=Enable WOL usb
    Wants=network-pre.target
    After=network-pre.target NetworkManager.service
    
    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g ; sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup"" ; sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup""
    Restart=on-failure
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

13. Also, enable the unit.

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl enable wol.service

14. Profit! Enjoy your game by streaming to your deck from your mobile phone through Steam Link.

&#x200B;

**Caveats and TODOs:**

1. Only deck built in screen is turned on when turning on through WOL. If you have any suggestion how to turn on both displays, please let me know.
2. Haven't fully tested the systemd service yet."
2024-04-11 15:24:11,Ungrateful but I feel guilty if I stop doing what I should,1,1c1hu6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1c1hu6c/ungrateful_but_i_feel_guilty_if_i_stop_doing_what/,0,1712849051.0,"I have a narcissistic mom in her early 60's and I'm the youngest between me and my sister who is over a decade older than me.(30F,40F). From I've been 14 I've been helping with my mom's healthcare because she is diabetic etc. In my 20's I would be there mostly as her caregiver in the hospital and at home, sometimes financially when we would have to go to the hospital for an emergency and be there as emotional support.

Idk what but the caring mother I knew changed into a manipulative narcissistic character.

I'd realize growing up I would be labelled as the black sheep even though I always assisted heavily around the house everyday, followed rules but had my own bit of individuality I would be passionate about(piercings) but I always did well in school. I went through a traumatic situation that affected my university years and she would throw it in my face and call me mad(mentally unstable) even when she knows I am telling the truth. 

One time I told her something that another family member said about her and to get out of it, the person lied and tried to accuse me of making it up or being mad. My mother also berated me with those insults and say I must be mad. Later on, she found information confirming that I was telling the truth and never apologized. 

She also has a friend from the UK she knows from her childhood that she only talks about my older sister with and her kids. She never mentions any updates about me or good things with me.

We live in a family home(30F) with other family members but I take care of her daily. In our neighbourhood when we have an argument she would be on the top of her lungs calling me mental and making it seem to others as if I suffer from mental health issues. Quite a few people in the neighbourhood know me and she has no qualms embarassing me. In the country I live there are severe negative connotations and stigma associated with mental health issues and alot of people who suffer from this disease are met with violence.

At this point, this is one of the things she constantly says on the top of her voice. Living in a neighbourhood where people can easily hear this and spread gossip, I believe she chooses to do this to me because no matter what I always come back and help her and speak to her. Whereby with my older sister, she couldnt do or say half of these things to her without significant repercussions or my sister deciding to not speak with her again or allow her to see her children. 

I hate toxicity and even though I have my flaws I hate that I have to be consistently berated, attacked and embarassed but feel guilty if I put my foot down and stop caring for her. I dont deserve this treatment and its crazy because everybody else sees her as a nice sweetheart but she has some terrible narcissistic traits that are hurtful. 

She throws rocks and hides her hands and no matter what I do for her, sacrifice for her... its never enough.

I put studying last, classes, things I have to do JUST so I can be able to care for her and give her the things she needs to be comfortable. I put myself 2nd or last but I seem to be the most hated.

I even get blamed for situations where I am the victim and didnt do anything to deserve it. 

So my question is, should I just move out and cut all ties or stay a little longer(by the end of the year) and let them know I will be moving out by then so they can arrange other plans?

My mental health is declining because of how I am being treated and I cannot continue to allow this anymore. I am deeply hurt and keep getting hurt in every corner of my life.

I left out alot of details but I have always been there with my mother through thick and thin and even though my older sister is in a better financial position than I at the moment I always try to do the best that I can.

I hope someone understands me at the very least. I'm not putting myself as this woe is me character ...I dont have any issues having my mother as the biggest priority in my life but shes very disrespectful and hurtful too many times and I dont think I can continue to take it.

I bought an unused tube of Melamet off Vinted and I started using it (just on the upper lip area) last year. I probably only used it consistently for 2 weeks in the evening, and I was really careful in the sunlight afterward (factor 50!) It faded this winter (I’m UK-based) but then I started using Glycolic Acid toner consistently to help with my hormonal acne. Whilst it helped a lot with the acne, it’s now made my hyperpigmentation worse! I’ve been reading all the risks about hydroquinone and I don’t want to use it again I( was stupid for even using it in the first place).

Do you think I’ve done any damage by using it for that brief period, and what safe alternatives are there to help minimise fade the tan-mustache?! "

Myself and my partner are preparing our application for an Unmarried Partner Family Visa - and were hoping to get some advice from the community at large - after a vary underwhelming encounter with an immigration firm we were hoping to use - who doesn't seem to be up on the latest UKVI changes etc.   


I am originally from the US and have been in the UK for 3 years as of next week, on a student visa which expires in early May. My partner is a British citizen, and we have been together in a relationship for 2 years 1 month, and living together for 2 years.   


We have lived together at 2 different addresses within the UK and have an array of documents to prove this in each of our names, as well as joint documents.   


We also have some photos and letters of support from UK family and friends regarding our relationship - so I am not concerned about the relationship or cohabitation aspects of the application.   


The reason we have been seeking out professional advice in the first place, was that my partner was let go from his employer in Feb 2024, just as we were gearing up to start our application. He had been with that employer for nearly 2 years, making £75k and we have all of those payslips + bank statements.  


He found a new job shortly after being let go, at the same salary - but his start date at the new job is not until the 29th of April. We have the settlement agreement from the old employer, the offer letter from the new employer etc as well.   


My partner also receives PIP so this makes us exempt from meeting the standard requirement, and needing to show adequate maintenance instead.   


As far as I know, you can combine PIP + income to show this - and when combined with his salary in relation to our housing costs (rent and council tax) we more than meet adequate maintenance   


But I am not sure if or how the slight ""gap"" in payslips will impact us - or if it will, given we had ""income"" from the settlement agreement from the old employer and there is a new job offer on the table at the same salary level.   


I am not sure how to frame this in a cover letter, or what/how much financial documents to show - and after speaking to the basically useless immigration firm - I am now confused as to whether we can apply now - or need to wait for him to actually ""start"" the new job.   


 I have finished my degree and have the right to work full time on my current visa until it expires, as a student who has finished their degree - and I also have an offer letter for a job which I start soon and which will provide an additional amount of salary - if that is useful as well.   


At this point, other than knowing which financial documents to send, if we are still able to - as well as how or if this gap will impact us - I would rather handle this myself if at all possible - as all other aspects of the application are straight forward, and I like to be in control of matters like tis as well as aware of all correspondence - as opposed to letting someone who may do a bad job - try to do it for me.   


I would really appreciate any help or advice. Thanks so much!

They are somewhat collectible to me, but really don't have monetary value. The declared value on this package was £50. I am certain I saw this on the outside of the package when I received it and the shipper is confident that's what he notated as well. Fast forward a couple of weeks and I have now been sent a UPS bill for $416.97.

This, of course, is absolutely nuts. So I called the Customs Broker phone line, and they told me the declared value was showing as $2550. This makes no sense to me. I saw there is a dispute button, but I threw away the packaging weeks ago, so I really have no evidence to prove my case. Is there anyone specific I should contact or anything to do to prove this wrong or bring up in a dispute? It will only let me type 80 characters, which isn't even enough for a full sentence."

I am a beginner tinwhistle player but advanced enough so that I started feeling limitations of the cheapest whistles: I've got a Feadog in D but the higher half of the higher octave is so unreliable and poor (too airy) sounding that it often limits me in playing.
I've found a guy who has four used whistles to sell, all in nice condition and reasonable prices. All in D so I am trying to convince myself there is no reason (other than GAS) to buy more than one. Maybe two if there is a reasonable explanation (like totally different sound or something).  
The four models I am choosing between are:
- Tony Dixon DX004   (https://www.tonydixonmusic.co.uk/product/soprano-whistle-key-of-d-4/)  
- Tony Dixon DX204D   (https://reverb.com/uk/item/12021977-dixon-solid-brass-d-whistle-dx204d)  
- Killarney Nickel   (https://mcneelamusic.com/wind/killarney-nickel-d-whistle/)  
- Goldfinch   (https://goldfinch.eu/pl/whistles/flazolet-high-d-goldfinch/)  
  
Which one (or maybe more than one?) should I choose and why?  
What is important to me? Ease of playing as I am still on my learning curve. ;)  
I've looked for reviews and sound samples online but this didn't solve my problem: I like the sound of every one of them (and it's really hard to tell the true sound from YT videos) and I haven't found any obvious reason to choose one over other ones.  
Please help me, share your recommendations, things I should know or anything that can help me choose. ;)   
And please, don't tell me ""buy them all"". I am trying to fight GAS, not feed it!  
Thanks!"

As the title suggests, I'm constantly tired. No matter how much sleep I get, I'm tired the entire day. My blood tests come back fine, so my doctor is saying nothing is wrong.

The thing is, this started around July 2023, progressively getting worse. I'm constantly battling fatigue, headaches, slight blurry vision in my right eye, and get more pins & needles in my arms and legs than I used to. I drink plenty of water during the day, I hit enough calories but still this is happening. 

What concerns me is that I can't check for swollen lymph nodes in my arm pits, as I had chest masculinisation surgery in 2021 and have no feeling in my chest/armpit area at all. 

Before all this started, I had a lot of energy but now I struggle to do anything but sleep.

I've been on testosterone injections (prescribed) since the start of 2023, and get injected every 10 weeks by my doctor. 

I'm really at a loss as to what is going on."

Thank you to all who have participated in the survey so far, your input has been a great help. Just doing a 2nd wave of promotion for the study to try an increase the sample size.

I'm a final year undergraduate student on a live production based course. I am conducting a study as part of my dissertation which is aimed towards live sound engineers and touches on the topic of sound restrictions.

If you would like to participate in the study please use the following link:

https://linktr.ee/jakedaysound

The aim is to identify some of the most influential effects that sound restrictions have on the performance of live sound engineers, both positive and negative, as well as get broad feedback on how engineers can work more effectively under said restrictions.

I am very thankful to anybody who participates in the study and would like you all to know that this would help me out a great deal.

If you have any questions about the study I will be happy to answer them at the following email address: jd1741@my.acm.ac.uk

Huel seems fantastic to me because in my case the convenience is undeniably very helpful. Plus ADHD is the worst thing ever for meal planning and I like to be able to scale up/down my meals.

Huel is marketed as a meal replacement and a lot of people for drawn to it for losing weight. But in my case I need to gain a bit or maintain and I'm trying to hit the NHS 2500 calorie recommendation as that is roughly close to my baseline. The obvious solution is ""scoop more you idiot"" but the costs do seem to rise quite quickly. I might be wrong though as I am very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel.

Generally I make my own overnight oats and have them in the morning for breakfast plus a banana and tea which is about 547 kcal. Then lets have a hot & savory meal at lunch for 400 kcal, and then a hot and savory meal for dinner for another 400 kcal. I'll add on 120 kcal extra for the odd snack/tea. This totals at 1467 kcal so we're still 1033 kcal short of 2500. For those meals I'd need about 9 bags and it will cost around £167.40 (£2.65/meal) or £150.66 with student/NHS discount (£2.39/meal)

Some people have suggested using 3 scoops so we'll try that as well. 547 kcal for breakfast, 600 Huel H&S (Lunch), 600 Huel H&S (Dinner), and after adding on 120 kcal you get 1867 so still 633 kcal short of 2500. Going by my bad maths I'd need about 13 bags of Huel H&S at £223.20 (£3.98/meal) or £217.62 with student/NHS discount (£3.58/meal).

Then lets try add in one Huel Black drink per day at 400 kcal which totals at 2278 kcal (362 short of 2500). This would be about £298.80 (£3.16/meal) or £268.92 with student/NHS discount (£2.84/meal).

So assuming I haven't made any horrible errors in my maths £2.84/meal still is pretty damn good. £268.92 seems expensive but for a month of food it might not even be that bad (again very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel). I think what I might do is buy a 20kg bag of basmati rice and throw it in the rice cooker which should boost the calories much higher and cheaper which I can combine with the Huel meals. Or throw in some naan bread etc. Huel is still great and it's definitely better than my standard diet both in nutrition and cost regardless."

My online group said here was a good place where i could put my questions. I am in the UK, so UK doctors/practices would be brilliant, as I'm going private for this. My online reseach brought up many terms that I couldnt understand and I kept getting lost rabbit holes of looking what words mean.  
My questions are:

1) What is the difference between all the different methods of SRS, I know there is vaginoplasty and vulvoplasty, but I don't know what is what, as I said, I don't know anything. 

2) Is there any risks that I should worry about in each method (anything goes here, can be from ones that are common, to ones that are rare, however please catagorize them)

3) How good is the functionality of each method (like Q2, please catogorize them)

4) After SRS when can I start doing everything again? Ie having sex, being able to swim in chlorinated water, showering ect ect.

5) Any clinic in the UK anyone that anyone reccomend with pricing ranges, that would be helpful."

They started blowing up sometimes last year, and people always say because people ""expressing themselves or finding themselves"" mate how is your past life ""you"" if its not your current life but a past life?? Like that logic itself contradicts itself as well. It's awfully weird how literally 99 percent of therians are stuff like a fox or a dog or a cat but never something like an microorganism or an centipede. If therians are valid why are most of them cats or foxes etc and there's like barely ever any centipedes or ants. Like a lot more centipedes and ants have been killed when compares to cats lmao.They speak about shifts but then you have to wonder to yourself if they are pretending / convinced themseleves or if they have another mental disorder. I wouldn't attack a therian or hurt them or whatnot but I just can't wrap my head around it. I've sat and done research on research but therians are just contradicting themselves.
Some therians say ""we dont believe we were animals in our past life we believe we are spiritually connected"" and some say ""we only believe we were animals in our past lives"" now what does your past life have to do with your current life?? You can't remember what you had for breakfast a week ago but remember a whole ass past life?? Man wtf

Now according to the ny post:

**""Other research, conducted by Helen Clegg of the UK's University of Northampton, suggests that some therians may have higher levels of schizotypy, or schizotypal personality disorder. STPD is a condition marked by intense discomfort with social interactions and personal relationships""**

The same people who are therians today hated on the weird human collie dude a few years ago??? 

Physical transformation is impossible now there's no evidence but that belief. If you were an animal in your past life and have shifts etc why don't you eat your family and eat your pets or some shit?? Lmao


They experience species dysphoria too which is linked to other mental illnesses.

Interesting how most therians have a mental illness or struggle with depression or anxiety (which is also linked with species dysphoria)

Can't you just link zoanthropy to therianthropy??

I really, really, really don't want children and I am getting sterilised when I get surgery for my endometriosis late this year or early next (waiting for an appointment). Just the memory of the two times I had my IUD placed makes me sweat and I would rather not go through that ever again.  
Is there any harm in waiting until my surgery to take it out? Would it still be effective at all?

2024-04-11 15:05:48,Question for anyone who fenced before 1987 - Turning your back in the 1980s,3,1c1he6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fencing/comments/1c1he6o/question_for_anyone_who_fenced_before_1987/,0,1712847948.0,"I've gone on deep dive into the History of the turning your back rule. The earliest reference to turning your back not being allowed I could find was:

>There are a variety of other bad customs equally deserving of reprehension as becoming a genteel fencer; such, for example, as crying out after every thrust , and turning their back upon their adversary when too much or too closely pressed by him, either for the purpose of arresting his impetuosity or frustrating his design, or to get it decided whether or not his stance of which thrust was irregularly given, when he not been able to keep it off in the impulsion .

>Turning the back in this manner, either through imprudence or custom in a serious affair, is very justly condemned, for, could such a circumstance who might, be alleged in excuse for being wrongfully touched, if the fencer so turning his back were to receive a thrust owing to his having irregularly defended himself?

The Modern Art of Fencing 1822, pg 215-216:

https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Modern_Art_of_Fencing/d38w2eHuaVYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA216&printsec=frontcover

Which feels very similar to the idea that turning your back is unfair because it causes a halt.

So then I traced forward through various rulebooks. The AFLA rules from the late 1800s are all very sparse, and it's quite clear that they don't intend to cover all circumstances ([Roughly 20 rules in total](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1891.pdf)) so there's no mention of turning.

But then as I trace up through the [1940s rules](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1940.pdf), up to the [1970s](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1974.pdf), they all have something to this effect:

> In foil and sabre such movements as the displacement of the target, side-stepping, turns and half-turns, are permitted, but the reversal of positions on the strip is forbidden. Therefore, if the original positions are actually reversed, the contestants shall be placed back in the positions which they occupied at the moment the reversing movement was begun.

-AFLA Rules from 1940

Which explicitly allows turning, and makes no mention of turning causing a halt.


*Weirdly as an somewhat related aside - the 1950 rules seem to allow epee fencers to pass each other and keep fencing, and end up on opposite sides*

> *Reversing of Positions. EPEE.*

> *Movements which result in the reversal of the 88 original positions of the competitors are allowed on condition that they are executed without jostling the opponent. . The reversed position is secured if the reversal is more than half executed when the president of the jury gives the order "" Halt.""*

The earliest I example of turning causing a halt or a Yellow card is the 1987 USFA rules

https://imgur.com/a/5IVljMq

http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/USFA-Rules-1987-with-Operations-Manual.pdf

----

So the question is - what the fuck? Could you completely turn your back without penalty before 1987? or was it just one of those conventions that caused a halt and never was explicitly written down until the 1980s?"

Just wanted to provide a timeline of events to date:

\- Moved in 2020  
\- Tenancy expired years ago, on a rolling tenancy  
\- Deposit wasn't protected (Currently have a deposit not protected claim, [old thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bhukxh/used_a_no_win_no_fee_solicitor_for_deposit_not/))  
\- They gave us a section 21 notice and then withdrew it after we told them it's not valid. 

The property in question has been neglected by the landlord. It's had no gas safety certificate for years, boiler was replaced recently by landlord when the last gas safety failed (our lives were at risk from it according to the gas safety engineer due to products of combustion). House has mould everywhere. My mum had to call the police after being pushed hard by the landlord on one occasion (She's nearly 70 and has trouble walking as is), she was sympathetic decided not to pursue charges, we just don't allow landlord visits now unless it's for safety reasons (gas safety, etc). My mum does plan to move from here but I've told her to drag out the process until the local housing allowance is raised in 2025 hopefully, as my mum is disabled/doesn't work and rent is unaffordable in London at this point. 

I posted a thread about this back here:

**So fast forward to today, we've received a letter from the agency that the rent will increase from next month, are we fine to just ignore it and continue paying the same rent?** We did this before when they asked us previously, we just ignored it. It wasn't a Section 13 rent increase form, which I think it needs to be on, it's it's just a few lines of text on a piece of paper that they will increase it. We're happy for them to go through the Section 21 process but from what I understand they can never issue the Section 21 now since the deposit wasn't originally protected and since there's no gas safety cert?

Hi everyone and thanks for clicking!

I'm from the UK, 36, and I'm retired. I have a law degree I basically got just for a challenge, and I want to go back to university soon. 

I'm really into video games, especially sim racing, VR, emulated stuff, but everything really. From AAA titles to indie games, across most genres.

I'm very into music, I play a bit of ukulele and guitar, make beats sometimes, and have a pretty wide range I listen to. Mostly rap but anything and everything. 

I love keeping fit, train in a lot of different sports including basketball, football, tennis, etc. I also cycle, play darts, pool and poker, and love to cook. 

I'm working on a couple of projects, got a book or two in the works that are in semi-active development. "
2024-04-11 15:02:29,High Cost of Inconsistency of Prescription Cannabis: Navigating the Challenges,1,1c1hb70,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1c1hb70/high_cost_of_inconsistency_of_prescription/,0,1712847749.0,"#### Introduction

**In recent years, the United Kingdom has taken tentative steps towards recognizing cannabis for its medicinal properties, offering a glimmer of hope to those suffering from chronic pain and other debilitating conditions. However, this hope is frequently dimmed by the stark reality of inconsistent supply, leaving patients in a precarious limbo. This blog delves into the profound disappointment and pain felt by patients due to these supply issues, and examines the wider repercussions for legislative progress in the realm of prescription cannabis within the UK.**

#### The Emotional Toll of Inconsistent Supply

**For many patients, prescription cannabis is not a luxury; it’s a lifeline. The emotional toll of the supply’s inconsistency is profound. Imagine planning your life around a medication that can vanish from the pharmacy shelves without warning. Patients like Sarah (a pseudonym to protect privacy), who suffers from multiple sclerosis, describes the situation as “living on a seesaw,” where her ability to manage pain and maintain a semblance of normalcy is constantly in flux.**

**This inconsistency breeds not just disappointment but severe anxiety. Patients are left wondering not if, but when their supply will run out, forcing them into a cycle of stress that can exacerbate their conditions. Families watch helplessly as their loved ones grapple with the uncertainty, creating an additional emotional strain on already burdened households.**

#### Physical Consequences of Supply Disruptions

**The interruption in supply doesn’t just disrupt lives emotionally; it has tangible physical repercussions. When patients are forced to abruptly stop their cannabis-based treatments, the consequences can be dire. The return of chronic pain, the resurgence of seizures, and the increased intensity of symptoms can push patients back to square one, negating months or even years of progress.**

**Healthcare professionals, too, are caught in this dilemma. Doctors and nurses, who have seen the benefits of consistent treatment, find themselves unable to promise stability to their patients. Dr. Richardson, a pain specialist, highlights the frustration of “knowing what could help my patients, yet being powerless to assure them of continuous treatment.”**

#### Legislative Stagnation: A Barrier to Progress

**The journey of prescription cannabis in the UK is mired in legislative caution, a reflection of the complex global stance on cannabis. Despite evidence of its benefits, the inconsistency in supply has given lawmakers pause, slowing the momentum for further legalization and integration into the healthcare system. Critics argue that these supply issues serve as ammunition for opponents of prescription cannabis, complicating efforts to present it as a reliable and effective treatment option.**

**The impact of these supply inconsistencies extends beyond patient care; they shape the narrative around cannabis legislation. Lawmakers, faced with the challenge of ensuring a steady supply, may become hesitant to expand access, fearing the backlash from potential shortages. This hesitancy feeds into a vicious cycle, where legislative progress is stalled, further entrenching supply issues.**

#### The Ripple Effect on Healthcare and Society

**The ramifications of inconsistent cannabis supply ripple through the healthcare system and society. Healthcare providers, tasked with managing patient expectations and treatment plans, often find themselves at the mercy of supply chains they can’t control. This unpredictability can undermine the patient-provider trust relationship, crucial for effective care.**

**Moreover, societal perceptions of cannabis as a legitimate medical treatment are influenced by these supply issues. Public confidence in cannabis as a medical solution wanes with each report of shortages, affecting societal acceptance and potentially delaying wider recognition and use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes.**

**The economic impact is also significant. Patients, many of whom already face financial challenges due to their health conditions, may incur additional costs seeking alternative treatments. Healthcare providers, for their part, must navigate the administrative and financial burdens of managing an unreliable medication supply.**

#### Towards a Solution: Pathways and Possibilities

**Addressing the inconsistency in prescription cannabis supply requires a multifaceted approach. Firstly, regulatory changes could ease some of the barriers to a steady supply, such as restrictions on importation and cultivation. Developing domestic production capabilities is another avenue, potentially reducing reliance on international sources and making supply chains more resilient.**

**Advocacy plays a crucial role. Patient voices and their stories of how cannabis has transformed their lives are powerful tools in shaping public opinion and legislative action. By bringing these stories to the forefront, there’s an opportunity to influence policy and create a more supportive environment for prescription cannabis.**

**A collaborative effort among stakeholders—government bodies, healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, and the cannabis industry—is essential. Together, they can work towards creating a reliable, effective, and accessible prescription cannabis system in the UK.**

#### Conclusion

**The path to integrating prescription cannabis into the UK’s healthcare system is fraught with challenges, not least of which is the inconsistency in supply. This issue not only affects patients directly, causing disappointment and physical suffering, but also hampers legislative progress and has broader implications for healthcare and society. However, by acknowledging these challenges and working collaboratively towards solutions, there’s hope for a future where prescription cannabis is accessible to all who need it, marking a significant step forward in patient care and treatment options.**

At one point, I was fully convinced that reptiles were secretly running the world, and their advanced capabilities made them untouchable. It felt like they were messing with my mind, but I eventually realized I might be showing signs of schizophrenia. Despite the crazy thoughts, I knew I didn't have to buy into them completely. I grounded myself and took control of the wild theories.

I've seen countless shape-shifting videos that just make you think, and I noticed all the low vibrational people that dumb it down instantly. Like, hello? So every single reptilian video is supposed to be a glitch? I was like, ""That's weird."" One day, I did a search filter and found a video posted the same day. It was a guy talking over a compilation of reptiles and their eyes flickering. The video was strange because I couldn't find it elsewhere. It was sort of funny; he had Tourette's, I'm sure, and he was swearing and acting like a crazy, manic man, screaming, ""They're real f\*\*king reptile f\*\*ks!"" I was in hysterics of laughter because of his reaction. But something interesting was his stutters of words saying, ""They're f\*kn real, just look at those f\*ks!"" I got you, reptile f\*ks. It was interesting because it was a lot of celebs in interviews, and I grew up with friends with Tourette's, and I know they just spit mostly their thoughts. I was like, ""This dude is onto something here.""

So I did more research about celebs and found some Justin Bieber clip of him shifting at a police interview. I remember watching like, ""Oh, I remember seeing this years ago!"" Like it was a psyops, the entire Justin Bieber was arrested drama. I'm like, ""Hmm, what is it, psyops?"" And this, so I'm like, ""Let's try connecting these dots."" Then there's Adele's supposed article that got taken/wiped from the web. People talking about seeing it, but over the years, it was mostly forgotten about. But apparently, she shifted at her concert backstage, and no one cared really because they thought she was in a costume. But what I found eerie about the article is she supposed she said to her fans who seen her like a lizard, ""Don't worry, I'm one of the good ones."" So I'm like, ""Why is the website now on the info got a big stamp with FALSE written like you needed to know that specifically?"" Just like the crazy teacher from Incredibles film goes, ""Coincidence? I think not!"" Was my brain at that point. After that, I just learned about the reptilians thanks to lots of smart people discussing on here and the obvious low-level toxic mind games people attempt to dismiss the entire subject as very noticeable, like they are in on it, but that was likely bots or people just with no intellectual thoughts so trolls basically. 

Currently, though, I see the UK government being run by the most obvious reptile, Rishi Sunak, the big annoying psyops that feeds on your soul, as in mental energy, same with US President Biden that is obviously a clone or something is odd with that dude anyway. I heard Biden died, and his brother took his spot, but that's a different conspiracy that goes mad. I'm just spitballing now; Kanye West feels like a psyops, especially after he went missing and mentioned they controlled him before he went missing. The royals are the most obvious too; you just can't miss that psyops, and I believe they got Diana as they knew it would be a feast of energy they feed on, but hey, that's just a theory! A reptile theory!"

Many people are assuming he'll be more active here than at PBC. The key name at 147 appears to be Conor Benn, who likely can't fight in the UK - thus needs a big US name (Hearn may also see this as cashing out, with Boots having a higher ceiling). 

However, we also know that Devin Haney rehydrated to like 165lbs for his 140lb fight against Regis Prograis. Devin is fighting Garcia, and may someday fight Lopez and Matias, but after that... Could he move up to 147 sooner than expected?

Haney-Ennis would be one the highest level US fights that Matchroom has ever promoted. I'm curious if Matchroom could end up in a similar spot to what PBC had in 147, with Spence, Porter, Ugas & Garcia.

2024-04-11 14:57:52,Friend forgot their railcard for a train almost a year ago. Now expected to pay £550 in five days with zero prior notice.,1,1c1h6yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1c1h6yj/friend_forgot_their_railcard_for_a_train_almost_a/,3,1712847472.0,"Never thought I'd be posting in a place like this but I'm so pissed off for my friend right now and need as much information I can get on this to help, because this doesn't seem right at all.

As the title says, they paid for their ticket (I think Trans-Pennine) under a railcard which they couldn't present, a small journey which would've only skived them out of £5. (I know this isn't the rules for a penalty fare, but they have email proof of owning one). Conductor asked them for their details and could only remember him saying the rail would 'contact them and sort something out'. They never got anything back from them. No letter, no 21 day reminder email, nothing. 

In the situation of my friend who has hardship funds in place of the uni they're studying at, it would be pretty fair for them to assume the rail's let them off since they've been silent about it. Additionally, they are registered disabled. Ten months later they get a Magistrate's court fine in the post from Marston, asking them to pay £550 in five days, or face the usual baliff bollocks where they start confiscating. From what I've heard from my friend, citizens advice and Marston's said there's nothing they can do to cancel, or even lower the fine (even though it was due to a LOT of negligence on their part), and the absolute best they get is to have to set up a payment plan to pay the entire thing over 12 months. 

This fine goes so far against their policy on treating people in situations like my friend's, according to this page: [https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/](https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/) \- specifically the parts about a fine this large having a strong financial impact on them (their family lives on the poverty line), and the fact that they are given only five days to pay it.

This whole thing sounds incredibly predatory and mishandled and I feel like there must be something more to investigate about this. I know there's a lot of ambiguity in proving that no contact was sent prior, but supposing that there absolutely wasn't anything, what would be the outcome from there? 

Please lmk if there's anything else important to note because I am trying to keep this as anonymous as possible out of respect for my friend, who is naturally pretty fucking terrified right now.  TY"

I (26 M) am moving to the UK end of April from Spain. I have some money that I would like to start investing as well as an X amount per month as soon as the moving is done. I have never invested before and I am a bit lost of how moving countries could impact it. So let me bullet point my questions to make it easier:

- Can I start investing while in Spain and then continue in UK? Do brokers usually allow this or would I have to sell everything and buy again?
- A friend of mine who also lived in the UK told me that what he did is having his address still in Spain while living there, so he was technically investing from here. This was before Brexit. Is this legal and recommended? I thought having the visa and working there invalidates my current living address in Spain
- I do plan to stay in UK couple years and then most likely move around Europe until, at some point, going back to Spain (but who knows, maybe I stay in UK my whole live). Considering this, are ISAs still a valid approach? They have good tax benefits but if I retrieve the money while in another country I would get taxed normally and I could not keep adding money there. It seems that if I move, start an ISA and then in two years I leave I would have to sell stocks and buy them again, which sounds bad… (?). 
- Having all this in mind, what broker would you use? People have recommended me Vanguard, Fidelity, MyInvestor and even some banks. My plan is 95% index funds and maybe couple stocks just to try

Thanks guys! Appreciate your help"

It's supposed to be a review on how the uk handles trans kids and adolescence in light of the recent Bell v Tavistock case. The problem is Dr Hilary Cass has a clear prejudice that she pours into her work and gets approval from other abhorrent people such as the PM Rishi Sunak or JK Rowling. The biggest fear I have with it is that its already making a difference, there are already calls for several NHS GIC's to close and reevaluate how they interact with patient care for trans youths. Its genuinely concerning because it doesn't just pick out trams children, but now anyone under 25. We're slipping down this hill straight into the jaws of a genocide and it's terrorfying.

When reading the review, it paints itself put to be a review designed to protect kids. It then goes on to say we don't know enough about puberty blockers to deem them safe (despite the fact that we do and still perscribe them to cis kids). Like it straight up ignores 50 years of reaserch on something that has been proven safe and is still administerd other children in a similar vein. It goes on to talk about how the human brain isn't fully developed until you're 25, so we should make the system harder for people under 25 to prevent any mistakes. Like this just blatantly ignores the fact that medical gac has one of the lowest regret rates out there and is extremely successful.

It says to look for external factors like ADHD or Autism, like either of thoes would change the gender incongruence?? Like yeah, lots of trans people are neurdivergent, but that changes nothing since u can't ""cure"" neurdivergence and gac is still proven to work ridiculously well in helping trans people, regardless of neurological wiring. Then it claims that, because of bullying and transphobia, kids should be discouraged from socially transitioning. ""Hey kids, are you sick of being bullied?? Well why don't you change your name and build a new life for yourself!"" Like are you seriously gonna victim blame on an actual medical report like it isn't people like YOU (Dr Hilary Cass) who encourage that bullying and transphobia!

Even ignoring all of that, it still takes seriously concerns that pretty much all major Western medical organisations know to be false. Like the idea that trans kids don't exist. The document that is supposed to be helping trans kids, humouring the idea that they don't exist. It's such a translucent exercise of cis-superiority that would be generous to imply arrogance and alleviate any malice intent from the equation. It gives a platform to bigots to stand on ""don't believe me, well in section 12:14 of the Cass Review it clearly states...(some dribble about social transitioning being wrong)."" I saw a tweet from a JK Rowling fan saying that the cast need to apologise to her for their remarks in support of the trans community and she responded (roughly) ""I wouldn't accept it."" THEY WERE RIGHT!! JK deserves no apology from anyone, but now she has a government approved document to validate her bigotry.

What scariest of all is how close we are to being a genuinely unsafe country for trans people. How many kids are gonna kill themselves because of this review? How many people are going to be assaulted and beaten up because of this document?? Last time rishi made a joke about trans people hate crime towards trans people took a significant rise in the UK, I dread to see what's gonna happen because of this. "

AM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

Then, I alternate between

2. NIOD GHKCU - Keen for a more potent version of this 

Or

3. Timeless 20% Vitamin C Ferulic Acid Vitamin C – When I used TO vitamin C powder at night I used to see a wee difference in my complextion when I woke up but with this I don’t so wondering if anyone can recommend something better that isnt TO- as I didnt like the texture and cba with the mixing.

4. La Roche Psay Invisible fluid - guess this is fine for now but would love to know of tinted sun creams that are good for pale, cool undertoned skin. 

 PM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

5. Dermatica tretinoin 0.015%/Niacinamide 4% Azelaic Acid 4% Every second night with 1 weeks break before and after microneedling 

On the nights I am not using Tret I use the 2. NIOD or 3. Timeless depending on what I used in the morning 

5. Dermatica ceramide and peptide moisturiser - keen to swap this out as it seems over priced for what it is 

Once a week or once every fortnight a TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution depending on microneedling healing stage 

Microneedle approx once a month following the Pen Smit protocol 

Concerns in order of priority:

Pinkish, purple under eye circles which are often puffy, particularly on the right side. I’ve had these for as long as I can remember and am almost accepting that blepharoplasty is probably the only intervention that will remove them. Until I can afford surgery ( I live I the UK) I really hope that microneedling and RLT help reduce them and think I should also look into whether underlying health issues or allergys could be contributing to them but find it quite overwhelming and not really sure where best to start, what tests to prioritse, how long I would have to exclude something or say, take allergy meds to know… Wow they really get me down like I look SO sick and I dream of feeling comfortable make up free. 

Redness under nose, like a pink moustache that isnt particularly textured beyond what you would expect from spots. Have had this for as long as I can remember, wonder if it is from blowing my nose in the cold frequently (used to skate) or from a steroid cream I v vaguely remember being prescribed something.

General uneven looking complexion – blotchy, spots take ages to fade and up close you can see that my skin is soooo congested, I have white heads, black heads, pustules pretty much everywhere apart from my jaw. Possibly mild rosacea type 2 which might be why I randomly got blepharitus which is now reacurring. Not figured that out yet, god so much is up! Though I came for product recommendations I am also wondering if there are there any Derms or aestheticians that would let me DM them some photos? I feel like I need to show my face in its entirety both up close and selfie distance in various lights to get a good idea of what my skin is like and some features I have are pretty identifiable and though the changes are slim I would be mortified if someone I know saw them.

&#x200B;

Anyway, back to the main reason I am posting - 

 I was considering these products linked below which are a bit out of budget and not easy to get hold of as I am not US based and got stuck on whether the added kojic acid and alpha arbutin in [Brightening Tranexamic Acid Treatment – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/multi-bright-tranexamic-acid-treatment-5?_pos=1&_sid=0bb9e1337&_ss=r) would be an issue with GHKCU and the Tret 

and then when I considered  [Tranexamic Acid Serum – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/tranexamic-topical-acid-5?_pos=2&_sid=8227fd551&_ss=r)  with the added kojic acid and niacinamide gathered that I couldnt use this with vitamin C but got stuck on whether it would be ok following GHKCU / Tret"

* Applied: Feb 1
* Biometrics: Feb 6

* **Final decision refusal: March 28**
* Complaint submitted: April 2
* **Complaint not upheld: April 11**

**Refusal: ""***As above you did not respond to our emails requesting further information and you have not provided sufficient evidence that confirms the UK Ancestry link to your claimed grandparent.*""

**Birth Certificate:**

The letter states that I provided my ""Paternal Grandfathers death certificate."" 

I did not provide my grandfather's death certificate. The document is my father's birth certificate, whose middle name is my grandfather's first name. So I wondered if, at a quick glance, the assumption was that this document was of my grandfather. There is a deceased watermark on the document. I wonder if that, coupled with the similar names, resulted in a mixup. 

I will add that this document also clearly shows the names of my father's parents and has a large ""Birth Certificate"" title at the top. Not Death Certificate.

&#x200B;

**No Communication:**

In the emails asking for additional information, it was never mentioned that I provided my grandfather's death certificate. Only that they were not satisfied that I had provided enough evidence of an ancestral link. So, I assumed the original Birth Certificate was not sufficient. Thus, I gathered additional documents: **Act of Birth (long-form birth certificate),  Birth Certificate (original that I submitted), Baptismal Papers and my Grandparent's Marriage Certificate.**

The letter states that no communication was received in their attempts to follow up with me. This is untrue. I responded with the documents on the following dates:

**Email 1: March 1**

**April 2:** I submitted a complaint through the online form and directly to: [complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk](mailto:complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk)

The form did not allow me to provide an attachment, so I emailed with a very clear timeline, my documents, screenshots of my emails, and proof that they were received with the auto-email confirmation.

**April 11: Complaint not upheld**

Is my only option to apply for an administrative review? I do not have the option of waiting for a year. I also submitted my application before the new IHS increase, so re-applying means I will be paying a lot more. 

What I find frustrating is no one has addressed my points. All this complaint email reply confirms is that I've been refused. I feel like I am being forced to pay for a review. At this point, I would almost be happy if someone truly looked at my application and stated that they are rejecting me based on all of my evidence. 

Any advice or honest feedback, especially if there is a step where I've gone wrong, is appreciated. Feeling quite defeated..."

I plan on making a mixed-media animation, but I need a little help with some suggestions for my idea and the idea itself. It's not too long, but I would appreciate it if you could take some time and write some responses (as detailed as possible) to the questions.

Some questions are about manipulation that may be triggering.

The idea; My idea is a 1st person POV (point of view) of being manipulated. I plan on taping my phone to my head or something like that, so you see directly what my eyes see. I only want to interact with animations instead of real objects (making animations on top of the real world and interacting with them only). Please make your own suggestions if you think of any suggestions or ideas.

I want to make manipulators for different kinds of relationships (e.g., work relationships, friends, strangers, teachers and family. Though, I plan on adding a stalker (if I have time)). I want to give each manipulator a different art style (e.g., claymation, traditional art, papermation, etc.) I would appreciate it if you could participate in my survey; thank you in advance :)

It's supposed to be a review on how the uk handles trans kids and adolescence in light of the recent Bell v Tavistock case. The problem is Dr Hilary Cass has a clear prejudice that she pours into her work and gets approval from other abhorrent people such as the PM Rishi Sunak or JK Rowling. The biggest fear I have with it is that its already making a difference, there are already calls for several NHS GIC's to close and reevaluate how they interact with patient care for trans youths. Its genuinely concerning because it doesn't just pick out trams children, but now anyone under 25. We're slipping down this hill straight into the jaws of a genocide and it's terrorfying.

When reading the review, it paints itself put to be a review designed to protect kids. It then goes on to say we don't know enough about puberty blockers to deem them safe (despite the fact that we do and still perscribe them to cis kids). Like it straight up ignores 50 years of reaserch on something that has been proven safe and is still administerd other children in a similar vein. It goes on to talk about how the human brain isn't fully developed until you're 25, so we should make the system harder for people under 25 to prevent any mistakes. Like this just blatantly ignores the fact that medical gac has one of the lowest regret rates out there and is extremely successful.

It says to look for external factors like ADHD or Autism, like either of thoes would change the gender incongruence?? Like yeah, lots of trans people are neurdivergent, but that changes nothing since u can't ""cure"" neurdivergence and gac is still proven to work ridiculously well in helping trans people, regardless of neurological wiring. Then it claims that, because of bullying and transphobia, kids should be discouraged from socially transitioning. ""Hey kids, are you sick of being bullied?? Well why don't you change your name and build a new life for yourself!"" Like are you seriously gonna victim blame on an actual medical report like it isn't people like YOU (Dr Hilary Cass) who encourage that bullying and transphobia!

Even ignoring all of that, it still takes seriously concerns that pretty much all major Western medical organisations know to be false. Like the idea that trans kids don't exist. The document that is supposed to be helping trans kids, humouring the idea that they don't exist. It's such a translucent exercise of cis-superiority that would be generous to imply arrogance and alleviate any malice intent from the equation. It gives a platform to bigots to stand on ""don't believe me, well in section 12:14 of the Cass Review it clearly states...(some dribble about social transitioning being wrong)."" I saw a tweet from a JK Rowling fan saying that the cast need to apologise to her for their remarks in support of the trans community and she responded (roughly) ""I wouldn't accept it."" THEY WERE RIGHT!! JK deserves no apology from anyone, but now she has a government approved document to validate her bigotry.

What scariest of all is how close we are to being a genuinely unsafe country for trans people. How many kids are gonna kill themselves because of this review? How many people are going to be assaulted and beaten up because of this document?? Last time rishi made a joke about trans people hate crime towards trans people took a significant rise in the UK, I dread to see what's gonna happen because of this. "

I've already created two map visuals. The visual on the left is made from Table 1, and the visual on the right is from Table 2. It's a report for operations management to assess whether we have enough cover for upcoming jobs next year or if we need to hire more consultants in certain areas with high demand for upcoming jobs.

I get not talking to the police in case you say something incriminating but to refuse to answer basic questions like ""do you understand?"" and ""are you ok?"" was very weird.

I originally took it to be Ruby taking Jodi/lawyers advice to the extreme however when watching a video on YouTube (for the life of me I cannot remember which one - there have been so many) that went into the timeline of what happened and where everyone was, something struck me. The video included all the 911 operators calls and how she coordinated it all. When they worked out who R's mother was, they said the only thing they had on file for her was a driving offense recently.

Whoever did the video then included the bodycam footage of that traffic stop and Ruby behaves in a similar way, barely speaking actually barely looking at the officer. 

Anyone shed any light on this behaviour? Or is this normal for people to behave in the US towards police officers? (I'm UK based)

But overall, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd assume the work is similar / the same and pays relatively similar. I'd also really appreciate some insight on positives and negatives of this trade in the US as where I am in the UK it has felt like 70% of the day is spent in the van between jobs in traffic especially on maintenance & repair side of things, which is something I wouldn't miss if it's any different in the US. 

I would appreciate any advice on what to do and anything I should avoid taking this career path. Thanks :)"

2024-04-11 15:25:30,Rebooking Drew McIntyre's WWE Championship Reigns (Part 3:Second Reign),1,1c1hv8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybooking/comments/1c1hv8h/rebooking_drew_mcintyres_wwe_championship_reigns/,0,1712849130.0,"After his victory against AJ Styles at Wrestlemania 37, Drew McIntyre looks to move on from his feuds with established stars, looking to showcase rising talent in his reign. However, his first challenge is from a former WWE Champion, Sheamus, who doesn't win the United States Championship in this universe. After winning the Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal at Wrestlemania, Sheamus wins a fatal four-way also involving Bobby Lashley, Braun Strowman and The Miz. Instead of getting too directly involved with McIntyre, Sheamus focuses on winning matches and proving himself as a viable challenger. During these matches, McIntyre seems to be scouting Sheamus, going on commentary and watching at ringside. At Backlash, the two men beat the piss out of each other. At one point, Drew McIntyre breaks Sheamus' nose with an elbow. The ending comes when the champion reverses White Noise into a Future Shock, and hits a Claymore for the victory.

In between Backlash and Hell In A Cell, Drew McIntyre has 2 championship defenses in NXT and NXT UK, against Tommaso Ciampa and Ilja Dragunov, further cementing his intent on showing off younger stars. He obviously retains both times, yet comes very close to losing both times. Ciampa gets a near-fall with an Air Raid Siren off the top rope, while Dragunov gets a near fall with a H-Bomb and the Torpedo Moscow.

On Raw, Drew McIntyre has begun a feud with Aleister Black, who has been undefeated since turning heel in November. He beats Kevin Owens in a #1 contenders match, and plays mind games with McIntyre in the build, even threatening his family. At Hell In A Cell, it is again a match where both men beat the piss out of each other. Both men are continuing to brawl, when Black goes for the Black Mass, which McIntyre ducks and hits the Claymore. The champion goes for the cover and Black somehow kicks out. The challenger gets on his knees, wanting McIntyre to hit another Claymore. He does it, goes for the cover, and wins. 

Going into Money In The Bank, McIntyre returns to his feud with The Club, now with Finn Balor who has returned from NXT. Despite this, Kevin Owens becomes #1 contender for the WWE Championship by defeating Styles clean, planting the seeds for The Club's break-up. In the build, Owens and McIntyre have to form an uneasy alliance to battle The Club, who keep meddling in their affairs. At Money In The Bank, The Club continue to get involved, at one point inadvertantly helping Kevin Owens stay in the match by putting his foot on the rope after the champion goes for the cover after a Claymore. Towards the end of the match, The Club attempt to get involved physically, yet Owens and McIntyre fight them off. When they finally clear them, the challenger goes for the Stunner when the champion's back is turned, yet McIntyre pushes him off and hits a Claymore for the victory. After the match, The Club attack both men, and Finn Balor holds up the WWE Championship, with AJ Styles looking on in envy.

Towards Summerslam, Drew McIntyre is caught up in the ongoing civil war within The Club. A 16-man #1 contenders tournament is made for the night after Money In The Bank to determine the WWE Championship challenger. AJ Styles beats Bobby Lashley and Finn Balor beats Kofi Kingston to make a Club final. In the final, Luke Gallows immediately punch both men at the same time, leading to a no-contest. After the match, Finn Balor states that it was their plan all along to get to the final and make it a no-contest, leading to a triple threat match being made for Summerslam. The following week on Raw, Drew McIntyre defeats AJ Styles in a rematch from Wrestlemania after Finn Balor accidentally costs his friend the match. Finn Balor attempts to help Styles up after the match, yet is shoved to the ground. The following week, Finn Balor defeats Drew McIntyre. On the go-home show, Balor and Styles, who are still not on great terms, battle against Drew McIntyre and a mystery partner. This mystery partner turns out to be Jinder Mahal, partly reuniting 3MB. McIntyre and Mahal win after Finn Balor accidentally hits Styles with a Shotgun Dropkick, leading to McIntyre hitting Styles with a Claymore to pin him and get the win. At Summerslam, Balor and Styles attempt to get along and take out McIntyre, and it works originally when they put him through the announce table with a Phenomenal Forearm. Inevitably however, it falls apart, and the men battle it out for 10 minutes. After a Double Clothesline, both men are down, and McIntyre regains the advantage. He is about to win the match with a Claymore, yet Gallows and Anderson come out and attack the champion. Styles and Balor join in, and after a 1916 on a chair, McIntyre is rendered out of the match completely. After this, it looks like the two challengers are going to be able to finish their battle. However, Gallows, Anderson and Balor turn to Styles, and beat the shit out of him. Gallows and Anderson hit the Magic Killer, and Balor hits two Coup De Grace's to win the match and the WWE Championship, turning on his best friend."

So far I've:
- washed the plant in the shower with plain water (preserving the soil because I don't have any to replace it with)
- I trimmed away (or pulled out) the brown crunchy dried leaves and stems
- with advice I made a dish soap, isopropyl alcohol and water mix in a spray bottle that I doused my plant with for a few days then did it less regularly like once a week ish because I was scared
- recently I put dish soap on a tissue and gave the leaves wipe to remove the white flakes I found on the leaves and the grown brown scales on others

When I got the plant, after trimming the green leaves were almost fully green but some of the tips of the leaves had browned and dried out. I'm noticing now that some of the previously fully green leaves are losing their green pigment and turning brown throughout. In fact, I'm noticing one of the new leaves that hasn't fully unfurled is turning brown too which is why I'm scared.

This is my first plant and I don't know what to do. I'm based in the UK for reference - I'd love some help on what this looks like to you and if you think I can save it please 🙏🏼 I'm hoping there's an ""easy"" way to save it.

Thank you xo
PS: there's one weird bunched up leaf in the last picture. It's been a few weeks and it hasn't opened up like some of the other new leaves. I'm thinking to cut it off? Thoughts?"
2024-04-11 15:24:41,Wake-On-Lan your SteamDeck: a full guide and caveats,1,1c1hujf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1c1hujf/wakeonlan_your_steamdeck_a_full_guide_and_caveats/,0,1712849081.0,"Recently I have been trying to get wake-on-lan (WOL) working on my LCD steamdeck with JSAUX dock. There has been many issues I have encountered, so I decided to summarize here so others can benefit.

**Why:**
* I want to play my steam library on my phone through steam link.


**Limitations:**

* You need a dock with Ethernet capability. Mine is [JSAUX 6-in-1 docking station](https://jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck).
* Easier to work with local network. If you want to do WOL over the internet, you need to setup port forwarding yourself, or configure a VPN (such as tailscale) to redirect your connection to one of your active computer/server in your home
* Steam is not officially supporting this feature. So it might break on future update.
* Do it at your own risk. Although everything I do is relatively safe, do not run commands from internet if you dont know what it will does to your system. 

&#x200B;

**How to:**

1. Unlock the readonly mode and make a sudo account. Please refer to other guides to do so. To confirm, try to install the packages we will need for checking later.

&#8203;

    $ sudo pacman -S gnu-netcat 

2. Get the ethernet *interface,* IP address, *MAC address,* and *broadcast address.* In the example below, *enp4s0f3u1u4* is the interface, and 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx is my MAC address, 163.xxx.xxx.xx is my IP address, and 163.xxx.xxx.255 is my broadcast address

&#8203;

    $ ip a
    5: enp4sxxxxxx: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 163.xxx.xxx.xx/xx brd 163.xxx.xxx.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp4s0f3u1u4

3. Enable the WOL feature of your network card. After querying ethtool interface, if Wake-on is ""d"", it means the feature is currently disabled. Then you need to set the value to ""g"". To make the changes persistent, please refer to the [archwiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wake-on-LAN).

&#8203;

    $ sudo ethtool enp4sxxxxxx | grep Wake-on
    
    Supports Wake-on: pumbag
    Wake-on: d
    
    $ sudo ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g

4. For the purpose of debugging, you can stop the firewall. It is not necessary for the WOL to works though. 

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl stop firewalld

5. Install a wake-on-lan application on your mobile phone, such as [this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.mrwebb.wakeonlan&hl=en&gl=US). Configure the MAC address, broadcast address, and IP address appropriately, and set WOL port to 9.
6. On your steamdeck, make sure firewall is disabled, and try to run the following command. While the command is running, try to press the send the WOL magic packet from your phone. If it works properly, then you will see some output on your steamdeck.

&#8203;

    $ sudo nc --udp --listen --local-port=9 --hexdump
    
    �������Lh��Lh��Lh��Lh����Lh��Lh�.... Received 102 bytes from the socket
    00000000  FF FF FF FF  FF FF 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  ........Lh....Lh
    00000010  17 E3 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  17 E3 00 E0  ....Lh....Lh....
    ...

7. If the previous part is working, congratulation, you can try to sleep your steamdeck and send the magic package from your phone to wake it up. Now you can reenable your firewall

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld

8. But, you might notice that, after the deck is sleeping for >15s, it will no longer wake up the deck. It leads to the second part to modify the ethernet power management. 
9. First, we need to find the appropriate usb devices for our ethernet. To do so, run lsusb. Try to list down all the ID for the Ethernet adapter, in my case, it's all the devices that starts with Realtek semiconductor, i.e. ""0bda:8153"", ""0bda:0411"", ""0bda:5411""

&#8203;

    $ sudo lsusb
    
    Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 003 Device 003: ID 13d3:3553 IMC Networks Bluetooth Radio
    Bus 003 Device 002: ID 28de:1205 Valve Software Steam Controller
    Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 0bda:8153 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8153 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter
    Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0bda:0411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. Hub
    Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 001 Device 004: ID 3434:0311 Keychron Keychron V1
    Bus 001 Device 003: ID 17ef:60e4 Lenovo Lenovo Legion M300 RGB Gaming Mouse
    Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0bda:5411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTS5411 Hub
    Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

10. The previous ID format is given as ""idVendor:idProduct"". We now need to find the appropriate driver for the those three usb devices. Run the following two commands, and pinpoint which usb devices corresponds to the IDs. 

&#8203;

    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idVendor
    ...
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/idVendor <==
    0bda
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/idVendor <==
    0bda
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/idVendor <==
    0bda
    ...
    
    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idProduct
    ...
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/idProduct <==
    5411
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/idProduct <==
    8153
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/idProduct <==
    0411
    ,,,
    

1. Check and enable the power management for these devices.  

&#8203;

    ## change the paths appropriately
    
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup
    disabled
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup
    enabled
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup
    disabled
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup""
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup""
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup""

11. Test to see if the WOL is working fine now. 
12. If it's working fine, you can make the changes persistent by writing a systemd service, as follows. Also after testing, turns out I dont need to enable ""1-1"" to make WOL work reliably.

&#8203;

    /etc/systemd/system/wol.service
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    [Unit]
    Description=Enable WOL usb
    Wants=network-pre.target
    After=network-pre.target NetworkManager.service
    
    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g ; sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup"" ; sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup""
    Restart=on-failure
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

13. Also, enable the unit.

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl enable wol.service

14. Profit! Enjoy your game by streaming to your deck from your mobile phone through Steam Link.

&#x200B;

**Caveats and TODOs:**

2024-04-11 15:24:11,Ungrateful but I feel guilty if I stop doing what I should,1,1c1hu6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1c1hu6c/ungrateful_but_i_feel_guilty_if_i_stop_doing_what/,0,1712849051.0,"I have a narcissistic mom in her early 60's and I'm the youngest between me and my sister who is over a decade older than me.(30F,40F). From I've been 14 I've been helping with my mom's healthcare because she is diabetic etc. In my 20's I would be there mostly as her caregiver in the hospital and at home, sometimes financially when we would have to go to the hospital for an emergency and be there as emotional support.

Idk what but the caring mother I knew changed into a manipulative narcissistic character.

I'd realize growing up I would be labelled as the black sheep even though I always assisted heavily around the house everyday, followed rules but had my own bit of individuality I would be passionate about(piercings) but I always did well in school. I went through a traumatic situation that affected my university years and she would throw it in my face and call me mad(mentally unstable) even when she knows I am telling the truth. 

One time I told her something that another family member said about her and to get out of it, the person lied and tried to accuse me of making it up or being mad. My mother also berated me with those insults and say I must be mad. Later on, she found information confirming that I was telling the truth and never apologized. 

She also has a friend from the UK she knows from her childhood that she only talks about my older sister with and her kids. She never mentions any updates about me or good things with me.

We live in a family home(30F) with other family members but I take care of her daily. In our neighbourhood when we have an argument she would be on the top of her lungs calling me mental and making it seem to others as if I suffer from mental health issues. Quite a few people in the neighbourhood know me and she has no qualms embarassing me. In the country I live there are severe negative connotations and stigma associated with mental health issues and alot of people who suffer from this disease are met with violence.

At this point, this is one of the things she constantly says on the top of her voice. Living in a neighbourhood where people can easily hear this and spread gossip, I believe she chooses to do this to me because no matter what I always come back and help her and speak to her. Whereby with my older sister, she couldnt do or say half of these things to her without significant repercussions or my sister deciding to not speak with her again or allow her to see her children. 

I hate toxicity and even though I have my flaws I hate that I have to be consistently berated, attacked and embarassed but feel guilty if I put my foot down and stop caring for her. I dont deserve this treatment and its crazy because everybody else sees her as a nice sweetheart but she has some terrible narcissistic traits that are hurtful. 

She throws rocks and hides her hands and no matter what I do for her, sacrifice for her... its never enough.

I put studying last, classes, things I have to do JUST so I can be able to care for her and give her the things she needs to be comfortable. I put myself 2nd or last but I seem to be the most hated.

I even get blamed for situations where I am the victim and didnt do anything to deserve it. 

So my question is, should I just move out and cut all ties or stay a little longer(by the end of the year) and let them know I will be moving out by then so they can arrange other plans?

My mental health is declining because of how I am being treated and I cannot continue to allow this anymore. I am deeply hurt and keep getting hurt in every corner of my life.

I left out alot of details but I have always been there with my mother through thick and thin and even though my older sister is in a better financial position than I at the moment I always try to do the best that I can.

I hope someone understands me at the very least. I'm not putting myself as this woe is me character ...I dont have any issues having my mother as the biggest priority in my life but shes very disrespectful and hurtful too many times and I dont think I can continue to take it.

I bought an unused tube of Melamet off Vinted and I started using it (just on the upper lip area) last year. I probably only used it consistently for 2 weeks in the evening, and I was really careful in the sunlight afterward (factor 50!) It faded this winter (I’m UK-based) but then I started using Glycolic Acid toner consistently to help with my hormonal acne. Whilst it helped a lot with the acne, it’s now made my hyperpigmentation worse! I’ve been reading all the risks about hydroquinone and I don’t want to use it again I( was stupid for even using it in the first place).

Do you think I’ve done any damage by using it for that brief period, and what safe alternatives are there to help minimise fade the tan-mustache?! "

Myself and my partner are preparing our application for an Unmarried Partner Family Visa - and were hoping to get some advice from the community at large - after a vary underwhelming encounter with an immigration firm we were hoping to use - who doesn't seem to be up on the latest UKVI changes etc.   


I am originally from the US and have been in the UK for 3 years as of next week, on a student visa which expires in early May. My partner is a British citizen, and we have been together in a relationship for 2 years 1 month, and living together for 2 years.   


We have lived together at 2 different addresses within the UK and have an array of documents to prove this in each of our names, as well as joint documents.   


We also have some photos and letters of support from UK family and friends regarding our relationship - so I am not concerned about the relationship or cohabitation aspects of the application.   


The reason we have been seeking out professional advice in the first place, was that my partner was let go from his employer in Feb 2024, just as we were gearing up to start our application. He had been with that employer for nearly 2 years, making £75k and we have all of those payslips + bank statements.  


He found a new job shortly after being let go, at the same salary - but his start date at the new job is not until the 29th of April. We have the settlement agreement from the old employer, the offer letter from the new employer etc as well.   


My partner also receives PIP so this makes us exempt from meeting the standard requirement, and needing to show adequate maintenance instead.   


As far as I know, you can combine PIP + income to show this - and when combined with his salary in relation to our housing costs (rent and council tax) we more than meet adequate maintenance   


But I am not sure if or how the slight ""gap"" in payslips will impact us - or if it will, given we had ""income"" from the settlement agreement from the old employer and there is a new job offer on the table at the same salary level.   


I am not sure how to frame this in a cover letter, or what/how much financial documents to show - and after speaking to the basically useless immigration firm - I am now confused as to whether we can apply now - or need to wait for him to actually ""start"" the new job.   


 I have finished my degree and have the right to work full time on my current visa until it expires, as a student who has finished their degree - and I also have an offer letter for a job which I start soon and which will provide an additional amount of salary - if that is useful as well.   


At this point, other than knowing which financial documents to send, if we are still able to - as well as how or if this gap will impact us - I would rather handle this myself if at all possible - as all other aspects of the application are straight forward, and I like to be in control of matters like tis as well as aware of all correspondence - as opposed to letting someone who may do a bad job - try to do it for me.   


I would really appreciate any help or advice. Thanks so much!

They are somewhat collectible to me, but really don't have monetary value. The declared value on this package was £50.

Fast forward a couple of weeks and I have now been sent a UPS bill for $416.97.

This, of course, is absolutely nuts. So I called the Customs Broker phone line, and they told me the declared value was showing as $2550. This makes no sense to me. I saw there is a dispute button, but I threw away the packaging weeks ago, so I really have no evidence to prove my case. Is there anyone specific I should contact or anything to do to prove this wrong or bring up in a dispute? It will only let me type 80 characters, which isn't even enough for a full sentence."

I am a beginner tinwhistle player but advanced enough so that I started feeling limitations of the cheapest whistles: I've got a Feadog in D but the higher half of the higher octave is so unreliable and poor (too airy) sounding that it often limits me in playing.
I've found a guy who has four used whistles to sell, all in nice condition and reasonable prices. All in D so I am trying to convince myself there is no reason (other than GAS) to buy more than one. Maybe two if there is a reasonable explanation (like totally different sound or something).  
The four models I am choosing between are:
- Tony Dixon DX004   (https://www.tonydixonmusic.co.uk/product/soprano-whistle-key-of-d-4/)  
- Tony Dixon DX204D   (https://reverb.com/uk/item/12021977-dixon-solid-brass-d-whistle-dx204d)  
- Killarney Nickel   (https://mcneelamusic.com/wind/killarney-nickel-d-whistle/)  
- Goldfinch   (https://goldfinch.eu/pl/whistles/flazolet-high-d-goldfinch/)  
  
Which one (or maybe more than one?) should I choose and why?  
What is important to me? Ease of playing as I am still on my learning curve. ;)  
I've looked for reviews and sound samples online but this didn't solve my problem: I like the sound of every one of them (and it's really hard to tell the true sound from YT videos) and I haven't found any obvious reason to choose one over other ones.  
Please help me, share your recommendations, things I should know or anything that can help me choose. ;)   
And please, don't tell me ""buy them all"". I am trying to fight GAS, not feed it!

As the title suggests, I'm constantly tired. No matter how much sleep I get, I'm tired the entire day. My blood tests come back fine, so my doctor is saying nothing is wrong.

The thing is, this started around July 2023, progressively getting worse. I'm constantly battling fatigue, headaches, slight blurry vision in my right eye, and get more pins & needles in my arms and legs than I used to. I drink plenty of water during the day, I hit enough calories but still this is happening. 

What concerns me is that I can't check for swollen lymph nodes in my arm pits, as I had chest masculinisation surgery in 2021 and have no feeling in my chest/armpit area at all. 

Before all this started, I had a lot of energy but now I struggle to do anything but sleep.

I've been on testosterone injections (prescribed) since the start of 2023, and get injected every 10 weeks by my doctor. 

I'm really at a loss as to what is going on."

Thank you to all who have participated in the survey so far, your input has been a great help. Just doing a 2nd wave of promotion for the study to try an increase the sample size.

I'm a final year undergraduate student on a live production based course. I am conducting a study as part of my dissertation which is aimed towards live sound engineers and touches on the topic of sound restrictions.

If you would like to participate in the study please use the following link:

https://linktr.ee/jakedaysound

The aim is to identify some of the most influential effects that sound restrictions have on the performance of live sound engineers, both positive and negative, as well as get broad feedback on how engineers can work more effectively under said restrictions.

I am very thankful to anybody who participates in the study and would like you all to know that this would help me out a great deal.

If you have any questions about the study I will be happy to answer them at the following email address: jd1741@my.acm.ac.uk

Huel seems fantastic to me because in my case the convenience is undeniably very helpful. Plus ADHD is the worst thing ever for meal planning and I like to be able to scale up/down my meals.

Huel is marketed as a meal replacement and a lot of people for drawn to it for losing weight. But in my case I need to gain a bit or maintain and I'm trying to hit the NHS 2500 calorie recommendation as that is roughly close to my baseline. The obvious solution is ""scoop more you idiot"" but the costs do seem to rise quite quickly. I might be wrong though as I am very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel.

Generally I make my own overnight oats and have them in the morning for breakfast plus a banana and tea which is about 547 kcal. Then lets have a hot & savory meal at lunch for 400 kcal, and then a hot and savory meal for dinner for another 400 kcal. I'll add on 120 kcal extra for the odd snack/tea. This totals at 1467 kcal so we're still 1033 kcal short of 2500. For those meals I'd need about 9 bags and it will cost around £167.40 (£2.65/meal) or £150.66 with student/NHS discount (£2.39/meal)

Some people have suggested using 3 scoops so we'll try that as well. 547 kcal for breakfast, 600 Huel H&S (Lunch), 600 Huel H&S (Dinner), and after adding on 120 kcal you get 1867 so still 633 kcal short of 2500. Going by my bad maths I'd need about 13 bags of Huel H&S at £223.20 (£3.98/meal) or £217.62 with student/NHS discount (£3.58/meal).

Then lets try add in one Huel Black drink per day at 400 kcal which totals at 2278 kcal (362 short of 2500). This would be about £298.80 (£3.16/meal) or £268.92 with student/NHS discount (£2.84/meal).

So assuming I haven't made any horrible errors in my maths £2.84/meal still is pretty damn good. £268.92 seems expensive but for a month of food it might not even be that bad (again very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel). I think what I might do is buy a 20kg bag of basmati rice and throw it in the rice cooker which should boost the calories much higher and cheaper which I can combine with the Huel meals. Or throw in some naan bread etc. Huel is still great and it's definitely better than my standard diet both in nutrition and cost regardless."

I'm Mazey-Jessica, a transgender woman and pre all ops, and I'm looking at SRS, however, I am still new to the whole operation scene, but want them so badly. My online group said here was a good place where i could put my questions. I am in the UK, so UK doctors/practices would be brilliant, as I'm going private for this. My online reseach brought up many terms that I couldnt understand and I kept getting lost rabbit holes of looking what words mean.  
My questions are:

1) What is the difference between all the different methods of SRS, I know there is vaginoplasty and vulvoplasty, but I don't know what is what, as I said, I don't know anything. 

2) Is there any risks that I should worry about in each method (anything goes here, can be from ones that are common, to ones that are rare, however please catagorize them)

3) How good is the functionality of each method (like Q2, please catogorize them)

4) After SRS when can I start doing everything again? Ie having sex, being able to swim in chlorinated water, showering ect ect.

5) Any clinic in the UK anyone that anyone reccomend with pricing ranges, that would be helpful."

They started blowing up sometimes last year, and people always say because people ""expressing themselves or finding themselves"" mate how is your past life ""you"" if its not your current life but a past life?? Like that logic itself contradicts itself as well. It's awfully weird how literally 99 percent of therians are stuff like a fox or a dog or a cat but never something like an microorganism or an centipede. If therians are valid why are most of them cats or foxes etc and there's like barely ever any centipedes or ants. Like a lot more centipedes and ants have been killed when compares to cats lmao.They speak about shifts but then you have to wonder to yourself if they are pretending / convinced themseleves or if they have another mental disorder. I wouldn't attack a therian or hurt them or whatnot but I just can't wrap my head around it. I've sat and done research on research but therians are just contradicting themselves.
Some therians say ""we dont believe we were animals in our past life we believe we are spiritually connected"" and some say ""we only believe we were animals in our past lives"" now what does your past life have to do with your current life?? You can't remember what you had for breakfast a week ago but remember a whole ass past life?? Man wtf

Now according to the ny post:

**""Other research, conducted by Helen Clegg of the UK's University of Northampton, suggests that some therians may have higher levels of schizotypy, or schizotypal personality disorder. STPD is a condition marked by intense discomfort with social interactions and personal relationships""**

The same people who are therians today hated on the weird human collie dude a few years ago??? 

Physical transformation is impossible now there's no evidence but that belief. If you were an animal in your past life and have shifts etc why don't you eat your family and eat your pets or some shit?? Lmao


They experience species dysphoria too which is linked to other mental illnesses.

Interesting how most therians have a mental illness or struggle with depression or anxiety (which is also linked with species dysphoria)

Can't you just link zoanthropy to therianthropy??

2024-04-11 15:05:48,Question for anyone who fenced before 1987 - Turning your back in the 1980s,3,1c1he6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fencing/comments/1c1he6o/question_for_anyone_who_fenced_before_1987/,0,1712847948.0,"I've gone on deep dive into the History of the turning your back rule. The earliest reference to turning your back not being allowed I could find was:

>There are a variety of other bad customs equally deserving of reprehension as becoming a genteel fencer; such, for example, as crying out after every thrust , and turning their back upon their adversary when too much or too closely pressed by him, either for the purpose of arresting his impetuosity or frustrating his design, or to get it decided whether or not his stance of which thrust was irregularly given, when he not been able to keep it off in the impulsion .

>Turning the back in this manner, either through imprudence or custom in a serious affair, is very justly condemned, for, could such a circumstance who might, be alleged in excuse for being wrongfully touched, if the fencer so turning his back were to receive a thrust owing to his having irregularly defended himself?

The Modern Art of Fencing 1822, pg 215-216:

https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Modern_Art_of_Fencing/d38w2eHuaVYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA216&printsec=frontcover

Which feels very similar to the idea that turning your back is unfair because it causes a halt.

So then I traced forward through various rulebooks. The AFLA rules from the late 1800s are all very sparse, and it's quite clear that they don't intend to cover all circumstances ([Roughly 20 rules in total](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1891.pdf)) so there's no mention of turning.

But then as I trace up through the [1940s rules](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1940.pdf), up to the [1970s](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1974.pdf), they all have something to this effect:

> In foil and sabre such movements as the displacement of the target, side-stepping, turns and half-turns, are permitted, but the reversal of positions on the strip is forbidden. Therefore, if the original positions are actually reversed, the contestants shall be placed back in the positions which they occupied at the moment the reversing movement was begun.

-AFLA Rules from 1940

Which explicitly allows turning, and makes no mention of turning causing a halt.


*Weirdly as an somewhat related aside - the 1950 rules seem to allow epee fencers to pass each other and keep fencing, and end up on opposite sides*

> *Reversing of Positions. EPEE.*

> *Movements which result in the reversal of the 88 original positions of the competitors are allowed on condition that they are executed without jostling the opponent. . The reversed position is secured if the reversal is more than half executed when the president of the jury gives the order "" Halt.""*

The earliest I example of turning causing a halt or a Yellow card is the 1987 USFA rules

https://imgur.com/a/5IVljMq

http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/USFA-Rules-1987-with-Operations-Manual.pdf

----

So the question is - what the fuck? Could you completely turn your back without penalty before 1987? or was it just one of those conventions that caused a halt and never was explicitly written down until the 1980s?"

Just wanted to provide a timeline of events to date:

\- Moved in 2020  
\- Tenancy expired years ago, on a rolling tenancy  
\- Deposit wasn't protected (Currently have a deposit not protected claim, [old thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bhukxh/used_a_no_win_no_fee_solicitor_for_deposit_not/))  
\- They gave us a section 21 notice and then withdrew it after we told them it's not valid. 

The property in question has been neglected by the landlord. It's had no gas safety certificate for years, boiler was replaced recently by landlord when the last gas safety failed (our lives were at risk from it according to the gas safety engineer due to products of combustion). House has mould everywhere. My mum had to call the police after being pushed hard by the landlord on one occasion (She's nearly 70 and has trouble walking as is), she was sympathetic decided not to pursue charges, we just don't allow landlord visits now unless it's for safety reasons (gas safety, etc). My mum does plan to move from here but I've told her to drag out the process until the local housing allowance is raised in 2025 hopefully, as my mum is disabled/doesn't work and rent is unaffordable in London at this point. 

I posted a thread about this back here:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bhukxh/used\_a\_no\_win\_no\_fee\_solicitor\_for\_deposit\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bhukxh/used_a_no_win_no_fee_solicitor_for_deposit_not/)

**So fast forward to today, we've received a letter from the agency that the rent will increase from next month, are we fine to just ignore it and continue paying the same rent?** We did this before when they asked us previously, we just ignored it. It wasn't a Section 13 rent increase form, which I think it needs to be on, it's it's just a few lines of text on a piece of paper that they will increase it. We're happy for them to go through the Section 21 process but from what I understand they can never issue the Section 21 now since the deposit wasn't originally protected and since there's no gas safety cert?

Hi everyone and thanks for clicking!

I'm from the UK, 36, and I'm retired. I have a law degree I basically got just for a challenge, and I want to go back to university soon. 

I'm really into video games, especially sim racing, VR, emulated stuff, but everything really. From AAA titles to indie games, across most genres.

I'm very into music, I play a bit of ukulele and guitar, make beats sometimes, and have a pretty wide range I listen to. Mostly rap but anything and everything. 

I love keeping fit, train in a lot of different sports including basketball, football, tennis, etc. I also cycle, play darts, pool and poker, and love to cook. 

I'm working on a couple of projects, got a book or two in the works that are in semi-active development. "
2024-04-11 15:02:29,High Cost of Inconsistency of Prescription Cannabis: Navigating the Challenges,1,1c1hb70,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1c1hb70/high_cost_of_inconsistency_of_prescription/,0,1712847749.0,"#### Introduction

**In recent years, the United Kingdom has taken tentative steps towards recognizing cannabis for its medicinal properties, offering a glimmer of hope to those suffering from chronic pain and other debilitating conditions. However, this hope is frequently dimmed by the stark reality of inconsistent supply, leaving patients in a precarious limbo. This blog delves into the profound disappointment and pain felt by patients due to these supply issues, and examines the wider repercussions for legislative progress in the realm of prescription cannabis within the UK.**

#### The Emotional Toll of Inconsistent Supply

**For many patients, prescription cannabis is not a luxury; it’s a lifeline. The emotional toll of the supply’s inconsistency is profound. Imagine planning your life around a medication that can vanish from the pharmacy shelves without warning. Patients like Sarah (a pseudonym to protect privacy), who suffers from multiple sclerosis, describes the situation as “living on a seesaw,” where her ability to manage pain and maintain a semblance of normalcy is constantly in flux.**

**This inconsistency breeds not just disappointment but severe anxiety. Patients are left wondering not if, but when their supply will run out, forcing them into a cycle of stress that can exacerbate their conditions. Families watch helplessly as their loved ones grapple with the uncertainty, creating an additional emotional strain on already burdened households.**

#### Physical Consequences of Supply Disruptions

**The interruption in supply doesn’t just disrupt lives emotionally; it has tangible physical repercussions. When patients are forced to abruptly stop their cannabis-based treatments, the consequences can be dire. The return of chronic pain, the resurgence of seizures, and the increased intensity of symptoms can push patients back to square one, negating months or even years of progress.**

**Healthcare professionals, too, are caught in this dilemma. Doctors and nurses, who have seen the benefits of consistent treatment, find themselves unable to promise stability to their patients. Dr. Richardson, a pain specialist, highlights the frustration of “knowing what could help my patients, yet being powerless to assure them of continuous treatment.”**

#### Legislative Stagnation: A Barrier to Progress

**The journey of prescription cannabis in the UK is mired in legislative caution, a reflection of the complex global stance on cannabis. Despite evidence of its benefits, the inconsistency in supply has given lawmakers pause, slowing the momentum for further legalization and integration into the healthcare system. Critics argue that these supply issues serve as ammunition for opponents of prescription cannabis, complicating efforts to present it as a reliable and effective treatment option.**

**The impact of these supply inconsistencies extends beyond patient care; they shape the narrative around cannabis legislation. Lawmakers, faced with the challenge of ensuring a steady supply, may become hesitant to expand access, fearing the backlash from potential shortages. This hesitancy feeds into a vicious cycle, where legislative progress is stalled, further entrenching supply issues.**

#### The Ripple Effect on Healthcare and Society

**The ramifications of inconsistent cannabis supply ripple through the healthcare system and society. Healthcare providers, tasked with managing patient expectations and treatment plans, often find themselves at the mercy of supply chains they can’t control. This unpredictability can undermine the patient-provider trust relationship, crucial for effective care.**

**Moreover, societal perceptions of cannabis as a legitimate medical treatment are influenced by these supply issues. Public confidence in cannabis as a medical solution wanes with each report of shortages, affecting societal acceptance and potentially delaying wider recognition and use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes.**

**The economic impact is also significant. Patients, many of whom already face financial challenges due to their health conditions, may incur additional costs seeking alternative treatments. Healthcare providers, for their part, must navigate the administrative and financial burdens of managing an unreliable medication supply.**

#### Towards a Solution: Pathways and Possibilities

**Addressing the inconsistency in prescription cannabis supply requires a multifaceted approach. Firstly, regulatory changes could ease some of the barriers to a steady supply, such as restrictions on importation and cultivation. Developing domestic production capabilities is another avenue, potentially reducing reliance on international sources and making supply chains more resilient.**

**Advocacy plays a crucial role. Patient voices and their stories of how cannabis has transformed their lives are powerful tools in shaping public opinion and legislative action. By bringing these stories to the forefront, there’s an opportunity to influence policy and create a more supportive environment for prescription cannabis.**

**A collaborative effort among stakeholders—government bodies, healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, and the cannabis industry—is essential. Together, they can work towards creating a reliable, effective, and accessible prescription cannabis system in the UK.**

#### Conclusion

**The path to integrating prescription cannabis into the UK’s healthcare system is fraught with challenges, not least of which is the inconsistency in supply. This issue not only affects patients directly, causing disappointment and physical suffering, but also hampers legislative progress and has broader implications for healthcare and society. However, by acknowledging these challenges and working collaboratively towards solutions, there’s hope for a future where prescription cannabis is accessible to all who need it, marking a significant step forward in patient care and treatment options.**

2024-04-11 15:00:49,"""Journey into Reptilian Conspiracy Theories""",1,1c1h9mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/reptilians/comments/1c1h9mr/journey_into_reptilian_conspiracy_theories/,1,1712847649.0,"I've had quite a journey with the whole reptilian conspiracy thing. At one point, I was fully convinced that reptiles were secretly running the world, and their advanced capabilities made them untouchable. It felt like they were messing with my mind, but I eventually realized I might be showing signs of schizophrenia. Despite the crazy thoughts, I knew I didn't have to buy into them completely. I grounded myself and took control of the wild theories.

I've seen countless shape-shifting videos that just make you think, and I noticed all the low vibrational people that dumb it down instantly. Like, hello? So every single reptilian video is supposed to be a glitch? I was like, ""That's weird."" One day, I did a search filter and found a video posted the same day. It was a guy talking over a compilation of reptiles and their eyes flickering. The video was strange because I couldn't find it elsewhere. It was sort of funny; he had Tourette's, I'm sure, and he was swearing and acting like a crazy, manic man, screaming, ""They're real f\*\*king reptile f\*\*ks!"" I was in hysterics of laughter because of his reaction. But something interesting was his stutters of words saying, ""They're f\*kn real, just look at those f\*ks!"" I got you, reptile f\*ks. It was interesting because it was a lot of celebs in interviews, and I grew up with friends with Tourette's, and I know they just spit mostly their thoughts. I was like, ""This dude is onto something here.""

So I did more research about celebs and found some Justin Bieber clip of him shifting at a police interview. I remember watching like, ""Oh, I remember seeing this years ago!"" Like it was a psyops, the entire Justin Bieber was arrested drama. I'm like, ""Hmm, what is it, psyops?"" And this, so I'm like, ""Let's try connecting these dots."" Then there's Adele's supposed article that got taken/wiped from the web. People talking about seeing it, but over the years, it was mostly forgotten about. But apparently, she shifted at her concert backstage, and no one cared really because they thought she was in a costume. But what I found eerie about the article is she supposed she said to her fans who seen her like a lizard, ""Don't worry, I'm one of the good ones."" So I'm like, ""Why is the website now on the info got a big stamp with FALSE written like you needed to know that specifically?"" Just like the crazy teacher from Incredibles film goes, ""Coincidence? I think not!"" Was my brain at that point. After that, I just learned about the reptilians thanks to lots of smart people discussing on here and the obvious low-level toxic mind games people attempt to dismiss the entire subject as very noticeable, like they are in on it, but that was likely bots or people just with no intellectual thoughts so trolls basically. 

Currently, though, I see the UK government being run by the most obvious reptile, Rishi Sunak, the big annoying psyops that feeds on your soul, as in mental energy, same with US President Biden that is obviously a clone or something is odd with that dude anyway. I heard Biden died, and his brother took his spot, but that's a different conspiracy that goes mad. I'm just spitballing now; Kanye West feels like a psyops, especially after he went missing and mentioned they controlled him before he went missing. The royals are the most obvious too; you just can't miss that psyops, and I believe they got Diana as they knew it would be a feast of energy they feed on, but hey, that's just a theory! A reptile theory!"

Many people are assuming he'll be more active here than at PBC. The key name at 147 appears to be Conor Benn, who likely can't fight in the UK - thus needs a big US name (Hearn may also see this as cashing out, with Boots having a higher ceiling). 

However, we also know that Devin Haney rehydrated to like 165lbs for his 140lb fight against Regis Prograis. Devin is fighting Garcia, and may someday fight Lopez and Matias, but after that... Could he move up to 147 sooner than expected?

Haney-Ennis would be one the highest level US fights that Matchroom has ever promoted. I'm curious if Matchroom could end up in a similar spot to what PBC had in 147, with Spence, Porter, Ugas & Garcia. 

What do you think?"
2024-04-11 14:57:52,Friend forgot their railcard for a train almost a year ago. Now expected to pay £550 in five days with zero prior notice.,1,1c1h6yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1c1h6yj/friend_forgot_their_railcard_for_a_train_almost_a/,3,1712847472.0,"Never thought I'd be posting in a place like this but I'm so pissed off for my friend right now and need as much information I can get on this to help, because this doesn't seem right at all.

As the title says, they paid for their ticket (I think Trans-Pennine) under a railcard which they couldn't present, a small journey which would've only skived them out of £5. (I know this isn't the rules for a penalty fare, but they have email proof of owning one). Conductor asked them for their details and could only remember him saying the rail would 'contact them and sort something out'. They never got anything back from them. No letter, no 21 day reminder email, nothing. 

In the situation of my friend who has hardship funds in place of the uni they're studying at, it would be pretty fair for them to assume the rail's let them off since they've been silent about it. Additionally, they are registered disabled. Ten months later they get a Magistrate's court fine in the post from Marston, asking them to pay £550 in five days, or face the usual baliff bollocks where they start confiscating. From what I've heard from my friend, citizens advice and Marston's said there's nothing they can do to cancel, or even lower the fine (even though it was due to a LOT of negligence on their part), and the absolute best they get is to have to set up a payment plan to pay the entire thing over 12 months. 

This fine goes so far against their policy on treating people in situations like my friend's, according to this page: [https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/](https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/) \- specifically the parts about a fine this large having a strong financial impact on them (their family lives on the poverty line), and the fact that they are given only five days to pay it.

This whole thing sounds incredibly predatory and mishandled and I feel like there must be something more to investigate about this. I know there's a lot of ambiguity in proving that no contact was sent prior, but supposing that there absolutely wasn't anything, what would be the outcome from there? 

Please lmk if there's anything else important to note because I am trying to keep this as anonymous as possible out of respect for my friend, who is naturally pretty fucking terrified right now.  TY"

I (26 M) am moving to the UK end of April from Spain. I have some money that I would like to start investing as well as an X amount per month as soon as the moving is done. I have never invested before and I am a bit lost of how moving countries could impact it. So let me bullet point my questions to make it easier:

- Can I start investing while in Spain and then continue in UK? Do brokers usually allow this or would I have to sell everything and buy again?
- A friend of mine who also lived in the UK told me that what he did is having his address still in Spain while living there, so he was technically investing from here. This was before Brexit. Is this legal and recommended? I thought having the visa and working there invalidates my current living address in Spain
- I do plan to stay in UK couple years and then most likely move around Europe until, at some point, going back to Spain (but who knows, maybe I stay in UK my whole live). Considering this, are ISAs still a valid approach? They have good tax benefits but if I retrieve the money while in another country I would get taxed normally and I could not keep adding money there. It seems that if I move, start an ISA and then in two years I leave I would have to sell stocks and buy them again, which sounds bad… (?). 
- Having all this in mind, what broker would you use? People have recommended me Vanguard, Fidelity, MyInvestor and even some banks. My plan is 95% index funds and maybe couple stocks just to try

It's supposed to be a review on how the uk handles trans kids and adolescence in light of the recent Bell v Tavistock case. The problem is Dr Hilary Cass has a clear prejudice that she pours into her work and gets approval from other abhorrent people such as the PM Rishi Sunak or JK Rowling. The biggest fear I have with it is that its already making a difference, there are already calls for several NHS GIC's to close and reevaluate how they interact with patient care for trans youths. Its genuinely concerning because it doesn't just pick out trams children, but now anyone under 25. We're slipping down this hill straight into the jaws of a genocide and it's terrorfying.

When reading the review, it paints itself put to be a review designed to protect kids. It then goes on to say we don't know enough about puberty blockers to deem them safe (despite the fact that we do and still perscribe them to cis kids). Like it straight up ignores 50 years of reaserch on something that has been proven safe and is still administerd other children in a similar vein. It goes on to talk about how the human brain isn't fully developed until you're 25, so we should make the system harder for people under 25 to prevent any mistakes. Like this just blatantly ignores the fact that medical gac has one of the lowest regret rates out there and is extremely successful.

It says to look for external factors like ADHD or Autism, like either of thoes would change the gender incongruence?? Like yeah, lots of trans people are neurdivergent, but that changes nothing since u can't ""cure"" neurdivergence and gac is still proven to work ridiculously well in helping trans people, regardless of neurological wiring. Then it claims that, because of bullying and transphobia, kids should be discouraged from socially transitioning. ""Hey kids, are you sick of being bullied?? Well why don't you change your name and build a new life for yourself!"" Like are you seriously gonna victim blame on an actual medical report like it isn't people like YOU (Dr Hilary Cass) who encourage that bullying and transphobia!

Even ignoring all of that, it still takes seriously concerns that pretty much all major Western medical organisations know to be false. Like the idea that trans kids don't exist. The document that is supposed to be helping trans kids, humouring the idea that they don't exist. It's such a translucent exercise of cis-superiority that would be generous to imply arrogance and alleviate any malice intent from the equation. It gives a platform to bigots to stand on ""don't believe me, well in section 12:14 of the Cass Review it clearly states...(some dribble about social transitioning being wrong)."" I saw a tweet from a JK Rowling fan saying that the cast need to apologise to her for their remarks in support of the trans community and she responded (roughly) ""I wouldn't accept it."" THEY WERE RIGHT!! JK deserves no apology from anyone, but now she has a government approved document to validate her bigotry.

What scariest of all is how close we are to being a genuinely unsafe country for trans people. How many kids are gonna kill themselves because of this review? How many people are going to be assaulted and beaten up because of this document?? Last time rishi made a joke about trans people hate crime towards trans people took a significant rise in the UK, I dread to see what's gonna happen because of this. "

I am under the impression that I can upload the confirmation email I received for the Police Certificate rather than the certificate itself and this will act as a substitute until my certificate arrives.

So I have a couple of questions:

1. Is my understanding correct regarding the confirmation email?
2. Should I wait until the nearer my deadline in the hope of getting my Police Certificate early, or should I submit everything as soon as possible along with the confirmation email?
3. Will my currently uploaded documents be checked for validity before they're submitted?

Would also love to know about any swaps you guys would recommend. 

AM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

Then, I alternate between

2. NIOD GHKCU - Keen for a more potent version of this 

Or

3. Timeless 20% Vitamin C Ferulic Acid Vitamin C – When I used TO vitamin C powder at night I used to see a wee difference in my complextion when I woke up but with this I don’t so wondering if anyone can recommend something better that isnt TO- as I didnt like the texture and cba with the mixing.

4. La Roche Psay Invisible fluid - guess this is fine for now but would love to know of tinted sun creams that are good for pale, cool undertoned skin. 

 PM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

5. Dermatica tretinoin 0.015%/Niacinamide 4% Azelaic Acid 4% Every second night with 1 weeks break before and after microneedling 

On the nights I am not using Tret I use the 2. NIOD or 3. Timeless depending on what I used in the morning 

5. Dermatica ceramide and peptide moisturiser - keen to swap this out as it seems over priced for what it is 

Once a week or once every fortnight a TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution depending on microneedling healing stage 

Microneedle approx once a month following the Pen Smit protocol 

Concerns in order of priority:

Pinkish, purple under eye circles which are often puffy, particularly on the right side. I’ve had these for as long as I can remember and am almost accepting that blepharoplasty is probably the only intervention that will remove them. Until I can afford surgery ( I live I the UK) I really hope that microneedling and RLT help reduce them and think I should also look into whether underlying health issues or allergys could be contributing to them but find it quite overwhelming and not really sure where best to start, what tests to prioritse, how long I would have to exclude something or say, take allergy meds to know… Wow they really get me down like I look SO sick and I dream of feeling comfortable make up free. 

Redness under nose, like a pink moustache that isnt particularly textured beyond what you would expect from spots. Have had this for as long as I can remember, wonder if it is from blowing my nose in the cold frequently (used to skate) or from a steroid cream I v vaguely remember being prescribed something.

General uneven looking complexion – blotchy, spots take ages to fade and up close you can see that my skin is soooo congested, I have white heads, black heads, pustules pretty much everywhere apart from my jaw. Possibly mild rosacea type 2 which might be why I randomly got blepharitus which is now reacurring. Not figured that out yet, god so much is up! Though I came for product recommendations I am also wondering if there are there any Derms or aestheticians that would let me DM them some photos? I feel like I need to show my face in its entirety both up close and selfie distance in various lights to get a good idea of what my skin is like and some features I have are pretty identifiable and though the changes are slim I would be mortified if someone I know saw them.

&#x200B;

Anyway, back to the main reason I am posting - 

 I was considering these products linked below which are a bit out of budget and not easy to get hold of as I am not US based and got stuck on whether the added kojic acid and alpha arbutin in [Brightening Tranexamic Acid Treatment – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/multi-bright-tranexamic-acid-treatment-5?_pos=1&_sid=0bb9e1337&_ss=r) would be an issue with GHKCU and the Tret 

and then when I considered  [Tranexamic Acid Serum – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/tranexamic-topical-acid-5?_pos=2&_sid=8227fd551&_ss=r)  with the added kojic acid and niacinamide gathered that I couldnt use this with vitamin C but got stuck on whether it would be ok following GHKCU / Tret"

I am close to waiving the white flag. I'm not one to call on the Universe for signs, but it sure feels like I'm not meant for the UK.

**Timeline:**

* Route: Ancestry Visa
* (Canadian) via my Paternal Grandparents
* Applied: Feb 1
* Biometrics: Feb 6
* Email 1 for additional information: Feb 19
* Email 2 for additional information: March 4
* Email 3 for additional information: March 18
* **Final decision refusal: March 28**
* Complaint submitted: April 2
* **Complaint not upheld: April 11**

**Refusal: ""***As above you did not respond to our emails requesting further information and you have not provided sufficient evidence that confirms the UK Ancestry link to your claimed grandparent.*""

**Birth Certificate:**

The letter states that I provided my ""Paternal Grandfathers death certificate."" 

I did not provide my grandfather's death certificate. The document is my father's birth certificate, whose middle name is my grandfather's first name. So I wondered if, at a quick glance, the assumption was that this document was of my grandfather. There is a deceased watermark on the document. I wonder if that, coupled with the similar names, resulted in a mixup. 

I will add that this document also clearly shows the names of my father's parents and has a large ""Birth Certificate"" title at the top. Not Death Certificate.

&#x200B;

**No Communication:**

In the emails asking for additional information, it was never mentioned that I provided my grandfather's death certificate. Only that they were not satisfied that I had provided enough evidence of an ancestral link. So, I assumed the original Birth Certificate was not sufficient. Thus, I gathered additional documents: **Act of Birth (long-form birth certificate),  Birth Certificate (original that I submitted), Baptismal Papers and my Grandparent's Marriage Certificate.**

The letter states that no communication was received in their attempts to follow up with me. This is untrue. I responded with the documents on the following dates:

**Email 1: March 1**

I sent an email to: [WorkNonSponsored.DocsRequested@fco.gov.uk](mailto:WorkNonSponsored.DocsRequested@fco.gov.uk) and received a confirmation auto-response of receipt.

**Email 2: March 24**

In response to an email stating that they still haven't heard from me, I replied to the email directly with the same information as provided on March 1. 

&#x200B;

**Complaint:** 

**April 2:** I submitted a complaint through the online form and directly to: [complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk](mailto:complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk)

The form did not allow me to provide an attachment, so I emailed with a very clear timeline, my documents, screenshots of my emails, and proof that they were received with the auto-email confirmation.

**April 11: Complaint not upheld**

Is my only option to apply for an administrative review? I do not have the option of waiting for a year. I also submitted my application before the new IHS increase, so re-applying means I will be paying a lot more. 

What I find frustrating is no one has addressed my points. All this complaint email reply confirms is that I've been refused. I feel like I am being forced to pay for a review. At this point, I would almost be happy if someone truly looked at my application and stated that they are rejecting me based on all of my evidence. 

Any advice or honest feedback, especially if there is a step where I've gone wrong, is appreciated. Feeling quite defeated..."

I get not talking to the police in case you say something incriminating but to refuse to answer basic questions like ""do you understand?"" and ""are you ok?"" was very weird.

I originally took it to be Ruby taking Jodi/lawyers advice to the extreme however when watching a video on YouTube (for the life of me I cannot remember which one - there have been so many) that went into the timeline of what happened and where everyone was, something struck me. The video included all the 911 operators calls and how she coordinated it all. When they worked out who R's mother was, they said the only thing they had on file for her was a driving offense recently.

Whoever did the video then included the bodycam footage of that traffic stop and Ruby behaves in a similar way, barely speaking actually barely looking at the officer. 

Anyone shed any light on this behaviour? Or is this normal for people to behave in the US towards police officers? (I'm UK based)

At one point, Drew McIntyre breaks Sheamus' nose with an elbow. The ending comes when the champion reverses White Noise into a Future Shock, and hits a Claymore for the victory.

In between Backlash and Hell In A Cell, Drew McIntyre has 2 championship defenses in NXT and NXT UK, against Tommaso Ciampa and Ilja Dragunov, further cementing his intent on showing off younger stars. He obviously retains both times, yet comes very close to losing both times. Ciampa gets a near-fall with an Air Raid Siren off the top rope, while Dragunov gets a near fall with a H-Bomb and the Torpedo Moscow.

On Raw, Drew McIntyre has begun a feud with Aleister Black, who has been undefeated since turning heel in November. He beats Kevin Owens in a #1 contenders match, and plays mind games with McIntyre in the build, even threatening his family. At Hell In A Cell, it is again a match where both men beat the piss out of each other. Both men are continuing to brawl, when Black goes for the Black Mass, which McIntyre ducks and hits the Claymore. The champion goes for the cover and Black somehow kicks out. The challenger gets on his knees, wanting McIntyre to hit another Claymore. He does it, goes for the cover, and wins. 

Going into Money In The Bank, McIntyre returns to his feud with The Club, now with Finn Balor who has returned from NXT. Despite this, Kevin Owens becomes #1 contender for the WWE Championship by defeating Styles clean, planting the seeds for The Club's break-up. In the build, Owens and McIntyre have to form an uneasy alliance to battle The Club, who keep meddling in their affairs. At Money In The Bank, The Club continue to get involved, at one point inadvertantly helping Kevin Owens stay in the match by putting his foot on the rope after the champion goes for the cover after a Claymore. Towards the end of the match, The Club attempt to get involved physically, yet Owens and McIntyre fight them off. When they finally clear them, the challenger goes for the Stunner when the champion's back is turned, yet McIntyre pushes him off and hits a Claymore for the victory. After the match, The Club attack both men, and Finn Balor holds up the WWE Championship, with AJ Styles looking on in envy.

Towards Summerslam, Drew McIntyre is caught up in the ongoing civil war within The Club. A 16-man #1 contenders tournament is made for the night after Money In The Bank to determine the WWE Championship challenger. AJ Styles beats Bobby Lashley and Finn Balor beats Kofi Kingston to make a Club final. In the final, Luke Gallows immediately punch both men at the same time, leading to a no-contest. After the match, Finn Balor states that it was their plan all along to get to the final and make it a no-contest, leading to a triple threat match being made for Summerslam. The following week on Raw, Drew McIntyre defeats AJ Styles in a rematch from Wrestlemania after Finn Balor accidentally costs his friend the match. Finn Balor attempts to help Styles up after the match, yet is shoved to the ground. The following week, Finn Balor defeats Drew McIntyre. On the go-home show, Balor and Styles, who are still not on great terms, battle against Drew McIntyre and a mystery partner. This mystery partner turns out to be Jinder Mahal, partly reuniting 3MB. McIntyre and Mahal win after Finn Balor accidentally hits Styles with a Shotgun Dropkick, leading to McIntyre hitting Styles with a Claymore to pin him and get the win. At Summerslam, Balor and Styles attempt to get along and take out McIntyre, and it works originally when they put him through the announce table with a Phenomenal Forearm. Inevitably however, it falls apart, and the men battle it out for 10 minutes. After a Double Clothesline, both men are down, and McIntyre regains the advantage. He is about to win the match with a Claymore, yet Gallows and Anderson come out and attack the champion. Styles and Balor join in, and after a 1916 on a chair, McIntyre is rendered out of the match completely. After this, it looks like the two challengers are going to be able to finish their battle. However, Gallows, Anderson and Balor turn to Styles, and beat the shit out of him. Gallows and Anderson hit the Magic Killer, and Balor hits two Coup De Grace's to win the match and the WWE Championship, turning on his best friend."

2024-04-11 15:24:54,I think my areca palm is dying,1,1c1huq9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1c1huq9,0,1712849094.0,"Hi y'all! I'm new to the Reddit and I wanted advice about my first plant, the areca palm. I inherited it and after getting it I was told by a friend that it has a scale infestation.

So far I've:
- washed the plant in the shower with plain water (preserving the soil because I don't have any to replace it with)
- I trimmed away (or pulled out) the brown crunchy dried leaves and stems
- with advice I made a dish soap, isopropyl alcohol and water mix in a spray bottle that I doused my plant with for a few days then did it less regularly like once a week ish because I was scared
- recently I put dish soap on a tissue and gave the leaves wipe to remove the white flakes I found on the leaves and the grown brown scales on others

When I got the plant, after trimming the green leaves were almost fully green but some of the tips of the leaves had browned and dried out. I'm noticing now that some of the previously fully green leaves are losing their green pigment and turning brown throughout. In fact, I'm noticing one of the new leaves that hasn't fully unfurled is turning brown too which is why I'm scared.

This is my first plant and I don't know what to do. I'm based in the UK for reference - I'd love some help on what this looks like to you and if you think I can save it please 🙏🏼 I'm hoping there's an ""easy"" way to save it.

Thank you xo
PS: there's one weird bunched up leaf in the last picture. It's been a few weeks and it hasn't opened up like some of the other new leaves. I'm thinking to cut it off? Thoughts?"
2024-04-11 15:24:41,Wake-On-Lan your SteamDeck: a full guide and caveats,1,1c1hujf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1c1hujf/wakeonlan_your_steamdeck_a_full_guide_and_caveats/,0,1712849081.0,"Recently I have been trying to get wake-on-lan (WOL) working on my LCD steamdeck with JSAUX dock. There has been many issues I have encountered, so I decided to summarize here so others can benefit.

**Why:**
* I want to play my steam library on my phone through steam link.


**Limitations:**

* You need a dock with Ethernet capability. Mine is [JSAUX 6-in-1 docking station](https://jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck).
* Easier to work with local network. If you want to do WOL over the internet, you need to setup port forwarding yourself, or configure a VPN (such as tailscale) to redirect your connection to one of your active computer/server in your home
* Steam is not officially supporting this feature. So it might break on future update.
* Do it at your own risk. Although everything I do is relatively safe, do not run commands from internet if you dont know what it will does to your system. 

&#x200B;

**How to:**

1. Unlock the readonly mode and make a sudo account. Please refer to other guides to do so. To confirm, try to install the packages we will need for checking later.

&#8203;

    $ sudo pacman -S gnu-netcat 

2. Get the ethernet *interface,* IP address, *MAC address,* and *broadcast address.* In the example below, *enp4s0f3u1u4* is the interface, and 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx is my MAC address, 163.xxx.xxx.xx is my IP address, and 163.xxx.xxx.255 is my broadcast address

&#8203;

    $ ip a
    5: enp4sxxxxxx: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 163.xxx.xxx.xx/xx brd 163.xxx.xxx.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp4s0f3u1u4

3. Enable the WOL feature of your network card. After querying ethtool interface, if Wake-on is ""d"", it means the feature is currently disabled. Then you need to set the value to ""g"". To make the changes persistent, please refer to the [archwiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wake-on-LAN).

&#8203;

    $ sudo ethtool enp4sxxxxxx | grep Wake-on
    
    Supports Wake-on: pumbag
    Wake-on: d
    
    $ sudo ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g

4. For the purpose of debugging, you can stop the firewall. It is not necessary for the WOL to works though. 

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl stop firewalld

5. Install a wake-on-lan application on your mobile phone, such as [this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.mrwebb.wakeonlan&hl=en&gl=US). Configure the MAC address, broadcast address, and IP address appropriately, and set WOL port to 9.
6. On your steamdeck, make sure firewall is disabled, and try to run the following command. While the command is running, try to press the send the WOL magic packet from your phone. If it works properly, then you will see some output on your steamdeck.

&#8203;

    $ sudo nc --udp --listen --local-port=9 --hexdump
    
    �������Lh��Lh��Lh��Lh����Lh��Lh�.... Received 102 bytes from the socket
    00000000  FF FF FF FF  FF FF 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  ........Lh....Lh
    00000010  17 E3 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  17 E3 00 E0  ....Lh....Lh....
    ...

7. If the previous part is working, congratulation, you can try to sleep your steamdeck and send the magic package from your phone to wake it up. Now you can reenable your firewall

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld

8. But, you might notice that, after the deck is sleeping for >15s, it will no longer wake up the deck. It leads to the second part to modify the ethernet power management. 
9. First, we need to find the appropriate usb devices for our ethernet. To do so, run lsusb. Try to list down all the ID for the Ethernet adapter, in my case, it's all the devices that starts with Realtek semiconductor, i.e. ""0bda:8153"", ""0bda:0411"", ""0bda:5411""

&#8203;

    $ sudo lsusb
    
    Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 003 Device 003: ID 13d3:3553 IMC Networks Bluetooth Radio
    Bus 003 Device 002: ID 28de:1205 Valve Software Steam Controller
    Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 0bda:8153 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8153 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter
    Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0bda:0411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. Hub
    Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 001 Device 004: ID 3434:0311 Keychron Keychron V1
    Bus 001 Device 003: ID 17ef:60e4 Lenovo Lenovo Legion M300 RGB Gaming Mouse
    Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0bda:5411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTS5411 Hub
    Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

10. The previous ID format is given as ""idVendor:idProduct"". We now need to find the appropriate driver for the those three usb devices. Run the following two commands, and pinpoint which usb devices corresponds to the IDs. 

&#8203;

    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idVendor
    ...
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/idVendor <==
    0bda
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/idVendor <==
    0bda
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/idVendor <==
    0bda
    ...
    
    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idProduct
    ...
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/idProduct <==
    5411
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/idProduct <==
    8153
    
    ==> /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/idProduct <==
    0411
    ,,,
    

1. Check and enable the power management for these devices.  

&#8203;

    ## change the paths appropriately
    
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup
    disabled
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup
    enabled
    $ cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup
    disabled
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup""
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup""
    
    $ sudo sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup""

11. Test to see if the WOL is working fine now. 
12. If it's working fine, you can make the changes persistent by writing a systemd service, as follows. Also after testing, turns out I dont need to enable ""1-1"" to make WOL work reliably.

&#8203;

    /etc/systemd/system/wol.service
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    [Unit]
    Description=Enable WOL usb
    Wants=network-pre.target
    After=network-pre.target NetworkManager.service
    
    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g ; sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1.4/power/wakeup"" ; sh -c ""echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/2-1/power/wakeup""
    Restart=on-failure
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

13. Also, enable the unit.

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl enable wol.service

14. Profit! Enjoy your game by streaming to your deck from your mobile phone through Steam Link.

&#x200B;

**Caveats and TODOs:**

1. Only deck built in screen is turned on when turning on through WOL. If you have any suggestion how to turn on both displays, please let me know.
2. Haven't fully tested the systemd service yet."
2024-04-11 15:24:11,Ungrateful but I feel guilty if I stop doing what I should,1,1c1hu6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1c1hu6c/ungrateful_but_i_feel_guilty_if_i_stop_doing_what/,0,1712849051.0,"I have a narcissistic mom in her early 60's and I'm the youngest between me and my sister who is over a decade older than me.(30F,40F). From I've been 14 I've been helping with my mom's healthcare because she is diabetic etc. In my 20's I would be there mostly as her caregiver in the hospital and at home, sometimes financially when we would have to go to the hospital for an emergency and be there as emotional support.

Idk what but the caring mother I knew changed into a manipulative narcissistic character.

I'd realize growing up I would be labelled as the black sheep even though I always assisted heavily around the house everyday, followed rules but had my own bit of individuality I would be passionate about(piercings) but I always did well in school. I went through a traumatic situation that affected my university years and she would throw it in my face and call me mad(mentally unstable) even when she knows I am telling the truth. 

One time I told her something that another family member said about her and to get out of it, the person lied and tried to accuse me of making it up or being mad. My mother also berated me with those insults and say I must be mad. Later on, she found information confirming that I was telling the truth and never apologized. 

She also has a friend from the UK she knows from her childhood that she only talks about my older sister with and her kids. She never mentions any updates about me or good things with me.

We live in a family home(30F) with other family members but I take care of her daily. In our neighbourhood when we have an argument she would be on the top of her lungs calling me mental and making it seem to others as if I suffer from mental health issues. Quite a few people in the neighbourhood know me and she has no qualms embarassing me. In the country I live there are severe negative connotations and stigma associated with mental health issues and alot of people who suffer from this disease are met with violence.

At this point, this is one of the things she constantly says on the top of her voice. Living in a neighbourhood where people can easily hear this and spread gossip, I believe she chooses to do this to me because no matter what I always come back and help her and speak to her. Whereby with my older sister, she couldnt do or say half of these things to her without significant repercussions or my sister deciding to not speak with her again or allow her to see her children. 

I hate toxicity and even though I have my flaws I hate that I have to be consistently berated, attacked and embarassed but feel guilty if I put my foot down and stop caring for her. I dont deserve this treatment and its crazy because everybody else sees her as a nice sweetheart but she has some terrible narcissistic traits that are hurtful. 

She throws rocks and hides her hands and no matter what I do for her, sacrifice for her... its never enough.

I put studying last, classes, things I have to do JUST so I can be able to care for her and give her the things she needs to be comfortable. I put myself 2nd or last but I seem to be the most hated.

I even get blamed for situations where I am the victim and didnt do anything to deserve it. 

So my question is, should I just move out and cut all ties or stay a little longer(by the end of the year) and let them know I will be moving out by then so they can arrange other plans?

My mental health is declining because of how I am being treated and I cannot continue to allow this anymore. I am deeply hurt and keep getting hurt in every corner of my life.

I left out alot of details but I have always been there with my mother through thick and thin and even though my older sister is in a better financial position than I at the moment I always try to do the best that I can.

I hope someone understands me at the very least. I'm not putting myself as this woe is me character ...I dont have any issues having my mother as the biggest priority in my life but shes very disrespectful and hurtful too many times and I dont think I can continue to take it.

I bought an unused tube of Melamet off Vinted and I started using it (just on the upper lip area) last year. I probably only used it consistently for 2 weeks in the evening, and I was really careful in the sunlight afterward (factor 50!) It faded this winter (I’m UK-based) but then I started using Glycolic Acid toner consistently to help with my hormonal acne. Whilst it helped a lot with the acne, it’s now made my hyperpigmentation worse! I’ve been reading all the risks about hydroquinone and I don’t want to use it again I( was stupid for even using it in the first place).

Do you think I’ve done any damage by using it for that brief period, and what safe alternatives are there to help minimise fade the tan-mustache?! "

All the clubs I've found so far are either barely active, disorganised, on bits of the Hudson that don't look particularly fun to sail on or essentially social clubs.

The biggest in the area seems Nyack. But any others I should check out?

Myself and my partner are preparing our application for an Unmarried Partner Family Visa - and were hoping to get some advice from the community at large - after a vary underwhelming encounter with an immigration firm we were hoping to use - who doesn't seem to be up on the latest UKVI changes etc.   


I am originally from the US and have been in the UK for 3 years as of next week, on a student visa which expires in early May. My partner is a British citizen, and we have been together in a relationship for 2 years 1 month, and living together for 2 years.   


We have lived together at 2 different addresses within the UK and have an array of documents to prove this in each of our names, as well as joint documents.   


We also have some photos and letters of support from UK family and friends regarding our relationship - so I am not concerned about the relationship or cohabitation aspects of the application.   


The reason we have been seeking out professional advice in the first place, was that my partner was let go from his employer in Feb 2024, just as we were gearing up to start our application. He had been with that employer for nearly 2 years, making £75k and we have all of those payslips + bank statements.  


He found a new job shortly after being let go, at the same salary - but his start date at the new job is not until the 29th of April. We have the settlement agreement from the old employer, the offer letter from the new employer etc as well.   


My partner also receives PIP so this makes us exempt from meeting the standard requirement, and needing to show adequate maintenance instead.   


As far as I know, you can combine PIP + income to show this - and when combined with his salary in relation to our housing costs (rent and council tax) we more than meet adequate maintenance   


But I am not sure if or how the slight ""gap"" in payslips will impact us - or if it will, given we had ""income"" from the settlement agreement from the old employer and there is a new job offer on the table at the same salary level.   


I am not sure how to frame this in a cover letter, or what/how much financial documents to show - and after speaking to the basically useless immigration firm - I am now confused as to whether we can apply now - or need to wait for him to actually ""start"" the new job.   


 I have finished my degree and have the right to work full time on my current visa until it expires, as a student who has finished their degree - and I also have an offer letter for a job which I start soon and which will provide an additional amount of salary - if that is useful as well.   


At this point, other than knowing which financial documents to send, if we are still able to - as well as how or if this gap will impact us - I would rather handle this myself if at all possible - as all other aspects of the application are straight forward, and I like to be in control of matters like tis as well as aware of all correspondence - as opposed to letting someone who may do a bad job - try to do it for me.   


I would really appreciate any help or advice. Thanks so much!

The team also investigated whether flat-faced ‘brachycephalic’ breeds were associated with higher risk. Surprisingly, longer-nosed ‘dolichocephalic’ breeds showed four times the odds of sedative/anaesthetic-related death compared with medium-length nose dogs, whereas no additional risk was seen in flat-faced breeds.

They are somewhat collectible to me, but really don't have monetary value. The declared value on this package was £50. I am certain I saw this on the outside of the package when I received it and the shipper is confident that's what he notated as well. Fast forward a couple of weeks and I have now been sent a UPS bill for $416.97.

This, of course, is absolutely nuts. So I called the Customs Broker phone line, and they told me the declared value was showing as $2550. This makes no sense to me. I saw there is a dispute button, but I threw away the packaging weeks ago, so I really have no evidence to prove my case. Is there anyone specific I should contact or anything to do to prove this wrong or bring up in a dispute? It will only let me type 80 characters, which isn't even enough for a full sentence."

I am a beginner tinwhistle player but advanced enough so that I started feeling limitations of the cheapest whistles: I've got a Feadog in D but the higher half of the higher octave is so unreliable and poor (too airy) sounding that it often limits me in playing.
I've found a guy who has four used whistles to sell, all in nice condition and reasonable prices. All in D so I am trying to convince myself there is no reason (other than GAS) to buy more than one. Maybe two if there is a reasonable explanation (like totally different sound or something).  
The four models I am choosing between are:
- Tony Dixon DX004   (https://www.tonydixonmusic.co.uk/product/soprano-whistle-key-of-d-4/)  
- Tony Dixon DX204D   (https://reverb.com/uk/item/12021977-dixon-solid-brass-d-whistle-dx204d)  
- Killarney Nickel   (https://mcneelamusic.com/wind/killarney-nickel-d-whistle/)  
- Goldfinch   (https://goldfinch.eu/pl/whistles/flazolet-high-d-goldfinch/)  
  
Which one (or maybe more than one?) should I choose and why?  
What is important to me? Ease of playing as I am still on my learning curve. ;)  
I've looked for reviews and sound samples online but this didn't solve my problem: I like the sound of every one of them (and it's really hard to tell the true sound from YT videos) and I haven't found any obvious reason to choose one over other ones.  
Please help me, share your recommendations, things I should know or anything that can help me choose. ;)   
And please, don't tell me ""buy them all"". I am trying to fight GAS, not feed it!  
Thanks!"

As the title suggests, I'm constantly tired. No matter how much sleep I get, I'm tired the entire day. My blood tests come back fine, so my doctor is saying nothing is wrong.

The thing is, this started around July 2023, progressively getting worse. I'm constantly battling fatigue, headaches, slight blurry vision in my right eye, and get more pins & needles in my arms and legs than I used to. I drink plenty of water during the day, I hit enough calories but still this is happening. 

What concerns me is that I can't check for swollen lymph nodes in my arm pits, as I had chest masculinisation surgery in 2021 and have no feeling in my chest/armpit area at all. 

Before all this started, I had a lot of energy but now I struggle to do anything but sleep.

I've been on testosterone injections (prescribed) since the start of 2023, and get injected every 10 weeks by my doctor. 

I'm really at a loss as to what is going on."

Thank you to all who have participated in the survey so far, your input has been a great help. Just doing a 2nd wave of promotion for the study to try an increase the sample size.

I'm a final year undergraduate student on a live production based course. I am conducting a study as part of my dissertation which is aimed towards live sound engineers and touches on the topic of sound restrictions.

If you would like to participate in the study please use the following link:

https://linktr.ee/jakedaysound

The aim is to identify some of the most influential effects that sound restrictions have on the performance of live sound engineers, both positive and negative, as well as get broad feedback on how engineers can work more effectively under said restrictions.

I am very thankful to anybody who participates in the study and would like you all to know that this would help me out a great deal.

If you have any questions about the study I will be happy to answer them at the following email address: jd1741@my.acm.ac.uk

Thanks again and I hope you all have a grand day!

Huel seems fantastic to me because in my case the convenience is undeniably very helpful. Plus ADHD is the worst thing ever for meal planning and I like to be able to scale up/down my meals.

Huel is marketed as a meal replacement and a lot of people for drawn to it for losing weight. But in my case I need to gain a bit or maintain and I'm trying to hit the NHS 2500 calorie recommendation as that is roughly close to my baseline. The obvious solution is ""scoop more you idiot"" but the costs do seem to rise quite quickly. I might be wrong though as I am very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel.

Generally I make my own overnight oats and have them in the morning for breakfast plus a banana and tea which is about 547 kcal. Then lets have a hot & savory meal at lunch for 400 kcal, and then a hot and savory meal for dinner for another 400 kcal. I'll add on 120 kcal extra for the odd snack/tea. This totals at 1467 kcal so we're still 1033 kcal short of 2500. For those meals I'd need about 9 bags and it will cost around £167.40 (£2.65/meal) or £150.66 with student/NHS discount (£2.39/meal)

Some people have suggested using 3 scoops so we'll try that as well. 547 kcal for breakfast, 600 Huel H&S (Lunch), 600 Huel H&S (Dinner), and after adding on 120 kcal you get 1867 so still 633 kcal short of 2500. Going by my bad maths I'd need about 13 bags of Huel H&S at £223.20 (£3.98/meal) or £217.62 with student/NHS discount (£3.58/meal).

Then lets try add in one Huel Black drink per day at 400 kcal which totals at 2278 kcal (362 short of 2500). This would be about £298.80 (£3.16/meal) or £268.92 with student/NHS discount (£2.84/meal).

So assuming I haven't made any horrible errors in my maths £2.84/meal still is pretty damn good. £268.92 seems expensive but for a month of food it might not even be that bad (again very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel). I think what I might do is buy a 20kg bag of basmati rice and throw it in the rice cooker which should boost the calories much higher and cheaper which I can combine with the Huel meals. Or throw in some naan bread etc. Huel is still great and it's definitely better than my standard diet both in nutrition and cost regardless."

2) Is there any risks that I should worry about in each method (anything goes here, can be from ones that are common, to ones that are rare, however please catagorize them)

3) How good is the functionality of each method (like Q2, please catogorize them)

4) After SRS when can I start doing everything again? Ie having sex, being able to swim in chlorinated water, showering ect ect.

5) Any clinic in the UK anyone that anyone reccomend with pricing ranges, that would be helpful."

They started blowing up sometimes last year, and people always say because people ""expressing themselves or finding themselves"" mate how is your past life ""you"" if its not your current life but a past life?? Like that logic itself contradicts itself as well. It's awfully weird how literally 99 percent of therians are stuff like a fox or a dog or a cat but never something like an microorganism or an centipede. If therians are valid why are most of them cats or foxes etc and there's like barely ever any centipedes or ants. Like a lot more centipedes and ants have been killed when compares to cats lmao.They speak about shifts but then you have to wonder to yourself if they are pretending / convinced themseleves or if they have another mental disorder. I wouldn't attack a therian or hurt them or whatnot but I just can't wrap my head around it. I've sat and done research on research but therians are just contradicting themselves.
Some therians say ""we dont believe we were animals in our past life we believe we are spiritually connected"" and some say ""we only believe we were animals in our past lives"" now what does your past life have to do with your current life?? You can't remember what you had for breakfast a week ago but remember a whole ass past life?? Man wtf

Now according to the ny post:

**""Other research, conducted by Helen Clegg of the UK's University of Northampton, suggests that some therians may have higher levels of schizotypy, or schizotypal personality disorder. STPD is a condition marked by intense discomfort with social interactions and personal relationships""**

The same people who are therians today hated on the weird human collie dude a few years ago??? 

Physical transformation is impossible now there's no evidence but that belief. If you were an animal in your past life and have shifts etc why don't you eat your family and eat your pets or some shit?? Lmao


They experience species dysphoria too which is linked to other mental illnesses.

Interesting how most therians have a mental illness or struggle with depression or anxiety (which is also linked with species dysphoria)

Can't you just link zoanthropy to therianthropy??

2024-04-11 15:05:48,Question for anyone who fenced before 1987 - Turning your back in the 1980s,3,1c1he6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fencing/comments/1c1he6o/question_for_anyone_who_fenced_before_1987/,0,1712847948.0,"I've gone on deep dive into the History of the turning your back rule. The earliest reference to turning your back not being allowed I could find was:

>There are a variety of other bad customs equally deserving of reprehension as becoming a genteel fencer; such, for example, as crying out after every thrust , and turning their back upon their adversary when too much or too closely pressed by him, either for the purpose of arresting his impetuosity or frustrating his design, or to get it decided whether or not his stance of which thrust was irregularly given, when he not been able to keep it off in the impulsion .

>Turning the back in this manner, either through imprudence or custom in a serious affair, is very justly condemned, for, could such a circumstance who might, be alleged in excuse for being wrongfully touched, if the fencer so turning his back were to receive a thrust owing to his having irregularly defended himself?

The Modern Art of Fencing 1822, pg 215-216:

https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Modern_Art_of_Fencing/d38w2eHuaVYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA216&printsec=frontcover

Which feels very similar to the idea that turning your back is unfair because it causes a halt.

So then I traced forward through various rulebooks. The AFLA rules from the late 1800s are all very sparse, and it's quite clear that they don't intend to cover all circumstances ([Roughly 20 rules in total](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1891.pdf)) so there's no mention of turning.

But then as I trace up through the [1940s rules](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1940.pdf), up to the [1970s](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1974.pdf), they all have something to this effect:

> In foil and sabre such movements as the displacement of the target, side-stepping, turns and half-turns, are permitted, but the reversal of positions on the strip is forbidden. Therefore, if the original positions are actually reversed, the contestants shall be placed back in the positions which they occupied at the moment the reversing movement was begun.

-AFLA Rules from 1940

Which explicitly allows turning, and makes no mention of turning causing a halt.


*Weirdly as an somewhat related aside - the 1950 rules seem to allow epee fencers to pass each other and keep fencing, and end up on opposite sides*

> *Reversing of Positions. EPEE.*

> *Movements which result in the reversal of the 88 original positions of the competitors are allowed on condition that they are executed without jostling the opponent. . The reversed position is secured if the reversal is more than half executed when the president of the jury gives the order "" Halt.""*

The earliest I example of turning causing a halt or a Yellow card is the 1987 USFA rules

https://imgur.com/a/5IVljMq

http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/USFA-Rules-1987-with-Operations-Manual.pdf

----

So the question is - what the fuck? Could you completely turn your back without penalty before 1987? or was it just one of those conventions that caused a halt and never was explicitly written down until the 1980s?"

Just wanted to provide a timeline of events to date:

\- Moved in 2020  
\- Tenancy expired years ago, on a rolling tenancy  
\- Deposit wasn't protected (Currently have a deposit not protected claim, [old thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bhukxh/used_a_no_win_no_fee_solicitor_for_deposit_not/))  
\- They gave us a section 21 notice and then withdrew it after we told them it's not valid. 

The property in question has been neglected by the landlord. It's had no gas safety certificate for years, boiler was replaced recently by landlord when the last gas safety failed (our lives were at risk from it according to the gas safety engineer due to products of combustion). House has mould everywhere. My mum had to call the police after being pushed hard by the landlord on one occasion (She's nearly 70 and has trouble walking as is), she was sympathetic decided not to pursue charges, we just don't allow landlord visits now unless it's for safety reasons (gas safety, etc). My mum does plan to move from here but I've told her to drag out the process until the local housing allowance is raised in 2025 hopefully, as my mum is disabled/doesn't work and rent is unaffordable in London at this point. 

I posted a thread about this back here:

**So fast forward to today, we've received a letter from the agency that the rent will increase from next month, are we fine to just ignore it and continue paying the same rent?** We did this before when they asked us previously, we just ignored it. It wasn't a Section 13 rent increase form, which I think it needs to be on, it's it's just a few lines of text on a piece of paper that they will increase it. We're happy for them to go through the Section 21 process but from what I understand they can never issue the Section 21 now since the deposit wasn't originally protected and since there's no gas safety cert?

I'm from the UK, 36, and I'm retired. I have a law degree I basically got just for a challenge, and I want to go back to university soon. 

I'm really into video games, especially sim racing, VR, emulated stuff, but everything really. From AAA titles to indie games, across most genres.

I'm very into music, I play a bit of ukulele and guitar, make beats sometimes, and have a pretty wide range I listen to. Mostly rap but anything and everything. 

I love keeping fit, train in a lot of different sports including basketball, football, tennis, etc. I also cycle, play darts, pool and poker, and love to cook. 

I'm working on a couple of projects, got a book or two in the works that are in semi-active development. "
2024-04-11 15:02:29,High Cost of Inconsistency of Prescription Cannabis: Navigating the Challenges,1,1c1hb70,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1c1hb70/high_cost_of_inconsistency_of_prescription/,0,1712847749.0,"#### Introduction

**In recent years, the United Kingdom has taken tentative steps towards recognizing cannabis for its medicinal properties, offering a glimmer of hope to those suffering from chronic pain and other debilitating conditions. However, this hope is frequently dimmed by the stark reality of inconsistent supply, leaving patients in a precarious limbo. This blog delves into the profound disappointment and pain felt by patients due to these supply issues, and examines the wider repercussions for legislative progress in the realm of prescription cannabis within the UK.**

#### The Emotional Toll of Inconsistent Supply

**For many patients, prescription cannabis is not a luxury; it’s a lifeline. The emotional toll of the supply’s inconsistency is profound. Imagine planning your life around a medication that can vanish from the pharmacy shelves without warning. Patients like Sarah (a pseudonym to protect privacy), who suffers from multiple sclerosis, describes the situation as “living on a seesaw,” where her ability to manage pain and maintain a semblance of normalcy is constantly in flux.**

**This inconsistency breeds not just disappointment but severe anxiety. Patients are left wondering not if, but when their supply will run out, forcing them into a cycle of stress that can exacerbate their conditions. Families watch helplessly as their loved ones grapple with the uncertainty, creating an additional emotional strain on already burdened households.**

#### Physical Consequences of Supply Disruptions

**The interruption in supply doesn’t just disrupt lives emotionally; it has tangible physical repercussions. When patients are forced to abruptly stop their cannabis-based treatments, the consequences can be dire. The return of chronic pain, the resurgence of seizures, and the increased intensity of symptoms can push patients back to square one, negating months or even years of progress.**

**Healthcare professionals, too, are caught in this dilemma. Doctors and nurses, who have seen the benefits of consistent treatment, find themselves unable to promise stability to their patients. Dr. Richardson, a pain specialist, highlights the frustration of “knowing what could help my patients, yet being powerless to assure them of continuous treatment.”**

#### Legislative Stagnation: A Barrier to Progress

**The journey of prescription cannabis in the UK is mired in legislative caution, a reflection of the complex global stance on cannabis. Despite evidence of its benefits, the inconsistency in supply has given lawmakers pause, slowing the momentum for further legalization and integration into the healthcare system. Critics argue that these supply issues serve as ammunition for opponents of prescription cannabis, complicating efforts to present it as a reliable and effective treatment option.**

**The impact of these supply inconsistencies extends beyond patient care; they shape the narrative around cannabis legislation. Lawmakers, faced with the challenge of ensuring a steady supply, may become hesitant to expand access, fearing the backlash from potential shortages. This hesitancy feeds into a vicious cycle, where legislative progress is stalled, further entrenching supply issues.**

#### The Ripple Effect on Healthcare and Society

**The ramifications of inconsistent cannabis supply ripple through the healthcare system and society. Healthcare providers, tasked with managing patient expectations and treatment plans, often find themselves at the mercy of supply chains they can’t control. This unpredictability can undermine the patient-provider trust relationship, crucial for effective care.**

**Moreover, societal perceptions of cannabis as a legitimate medical treatment are influenced by these supply issues. Public confidence in cannabis as a medical solution wanes with each report of shortages, affecting societal acceptance and potentially delaying wider recognition and use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes.**

**The economic impact is also significant. Patients, many of whom already face financial challenges due to their health conditions, may incur additional costs seeking alternative treatments. Healthcare providers, for their part, must navigate the administrative and financial burdens of managing an unreliable medication supply.**

#### Towards a Solution: Pathways and Possibilities

**Addressing the inconsistency in prescription cannabis supply requires a multifaceted approach. Firstly, regulatory changes could ease some of the barriers to a steady supply, such as restrictions on importation and cultivation. Developing domestic production capabilities is another avenue, potentially reducing reliance on international sources and making supply chains more resilient.**

**Advocacy plays a crucial role. Patient voices and their stories of how cannabis has transformed their lives are powerful tools in shaping public opinion and legislative action. By bringing these stories to the forefront, there’s an opportunity to influence policy and create a more supportive environment for prescription cannabis.**

**A collaborative effort among stakeholders—government bodies, healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, and the cannabis industry—is essential. Together, they can work towards creating a reliable, effective, and accessible prescription cannabis system in the UK.**

#### Conclusion

**The path to integrating prescription cannabis into the UK’s healthcare system is fraught with challenges, not least of which is the inconsistency in supply. This issue not only affects patients directly, causing disappointment and physical suffering, but also hampers legislative progress and has broader implications for healthcare and society. However, by acknowledging these challenges and working collaboratively towards solutions, there’s hope for a future where prescription cannabis is accessible to all who need it, marking a significant step forward in patient care and treatment options.**

At one point, I was fully convinced that reptiles were secretly running the world, and their advanced capabilities made them untouchable. It felt like they were messing with my mind, but I eventually realized I might be showing signs of schizophrenia. Despite the crazy thoughts, I knew I didn't have to buy into them completely. I grounded myself and took control of the wild theories.

I've seen countless shape-shifting videos that just make you think, and I noticed all the low vibrational people that dumb it down instantly. Like, hello? So every single reptilian video is supposed to be a glitch? I was like, ""That's weird."" One day, I did a search filter and found a video posted the same day. It was a guy talking over a compilation of reptiles and their eyes flickering. The video was strange because I couldn't find it elsewhere. It was sort of funny; he had Tourette's, I'm sure, and he was swearing and acting like a crazy, manic man, screaming, ""They're real f\*\*king reptile f\*\*ks!"" I was in hysterics of laughter because of his reaction. But something interesting was his stutters of words saying, ""They're f\*kn real, just look at those f\*ks!"" I got you, reptile f\*ks. It was interesting because it was a lot of celebs in interviews, and I grew up with friends with Tourette's, and I know they just spit mostly their thoughts. I was like, ""This dude is onto something here.""

So I did more research about celebs and found some Justin Bieber clip of him shifting at a police interview. I remember watching like, ""Oh, I remember seeing this years ago!"" Like it was a psyops, the entire Justin Bieber was arrested drama. I'm like, ""Hmm, what is it, psyops?"" And this, so I'm like, ""Let's try connecting these dots."" Then there's Adele's supposed article that got taken/wiped from the web. People talking about seeing it, but over the years, it was mostly forgotten about. But apparently, she shifted at her concert backstage, and no one cared really because they thought she was in a costume. But what I found eerie about the article is she supposed she said to her fans who seen her like a lizard, ""Don't worry, I'm one of the good ones."" So I'm like, ""Why is the website now on the info got a big stamp with FALSE written like you needed to know that specifically?"" Just like the crazy teacher from Incredibles film goes, ""Coincidence? I think not!"" Was my brain at that point. After that, I just learned about the reptilians thanks to lots of smart people discussing on here and the obvious low-level toxic mind games people attempt to dismiss the entire subject as very noticeable, like they are in on it, but that was likely bots or people just with no intellectual thoughts so trolls basically. 

Currently, though, I see the UK government being run by the most obvious reptile, Rishi Sunak, the big annoying psyops that feeds on your soul, as in mental energy, same with US President Biden that is obviously a clone or something is odd with that dude anyway. I heard Biden died, and his brother took his spot, but that's a different conspiracy that goes mad. I'm just spitballing now; Kanye West feels like a psyops, especially after he went missing and mentioned they controlled him before he went missing. The royals are the most obvious too; you just can't miss that psyops, and I believe they got Diana as they knew it would be a feast of energy they feed on, but hey, that's just a theory! A reptile theory!"

Many people are assuming he'll be more active here than at PBC. The key name at 147 appears to be Conor Benn, who likely can't fight in the UK - thus needs a big US name (Hearn may also see this as cashing out, with Boots having a higher ceiling). 

However, we also know that Devin Haney rehydrated to like 165lbs for his 140lb fight against Regis Prograis. Devin is fighting Garcia, and may someday fight Lopez and Matias, but after that... Could he move up to 147 sooner than expected?

Haney-Ennis would be one the highest level US fights that Matchroom has ever promoted. I'm curious if Matchroom could end up in a similar spot to what PBC had in 147, with Spence, Porter, Ugas & Garcia.

In the situation of my friend who has hardship funds in place of the uni they're studying at, it would be pretty fair for them to assume the rail's let them off since they've been silent about it. Additionally, they are registered disabled. Ten months later they get a Magistrate's court fine in the post from Marston, asking them to pay £550 in five days, or face the usual baliff bollocks where they start confiscating. From what I've heard from my friend, citizens advice and Marston's said there's nothing they can do to cancel, or even lower the fine (even though it was due to a LOT of negligence on their part), and the absolute best they get is to have to set up a payment plan to pay the entire thing over 12 months. 

This fine goes so far against their policy on treating people in situations like my friend's, according to this page: [https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/](https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/) \- specifically the parts about a fine this large having a strong financial impact on them (their family lives on the poverty line), and the fact that they are given only five days to pay it.

This whole thing sounds incredibly predatory and mishandled and I feel like there must be something more to investigate about this. I know there's a lot of ambiguity in proving that no contact was sent prior, but supposing that there absolutely wasn't anything, what would be the outcome from there? 

Please lmk if there's anything else important to note because I am trying to keep this as anonymous as possible out of respect for my friend, who is naturally pretty fucking terrified right now.  TY"

I (26 M) am moving to the UK end of April from Spain. I have some money that I would like to start investing as well as an X amount per month as soon as the moving is done. I have never invested before and I am a bit lost of how moving countries could impact it. So let me bullet point my questions to make it easier:

- Can I start investing while in Spain and then continue in UK? Do brokers usually allow this or would I have to sell everything and buy again?
- A friend of mine who also lived in the UK told me that what he did is having his address still in Spain while living there, so he was technically investing from here. This was before Brexit. Is this legal and recommended? I thought having the visa and working there invalidates my current living address in Spain
- I do plan to stay in UK couple years and then most likely move around Europe until, at some point, going back to Spain (but who knows, maybe I stay in UK my whole live). Considering this, are ISAs still a valid approach? They have good tax benefits but if I retrieve the money while in another country I would get taxed normally and I could not keep adding money there. It seems that if I move, start an ISA and then in two years I leave I would have to sell stocks and buy them again, which sounds bad… (?). 
- Having all this in mind, what broker would you use? People have recommended me Vanguard, Fidelity, MyInvestor and even some banks. My plan is 95% index funds and maybe couple stocks just to try

Thanks guys! Appreciate your help"

It's supposed to be a review on how the uk handles trans kids and adolescence in light of the recent Bell v Tavistock case. The problem is Dr Hilary Cass has a clear prejudice that she pours into her work and gets approval from other abhorrent people such as the PM Rishi Sunak or JK Rowling. The biggest fear I have with it is that its already making a difference, there are already calls for several NHS GIC's to close and reevaluate how they interact with patient care for trans youths. Its genuinely concerning because it doesn't just pick out trams children, but now anyone under 25. We're slipping down this hill straight into the jaws of a genocide and it's terrorfying.

When reading the review, it paints itself put to be a review designed to protect kids. It then goes on to say we don't know enough about puberty blockers to deem them safe (despite the fact that we do and still perscribe them to cis kids). Like it straight up ignores 50 years of reaserch on something that has been proven safe and is still administerd other children in a similar vein. It goes on to talk about how the human brain isn't fully developed until you're 25, so we should make the system harder for people under 25 to prevent any mistakes. Like this just blatantly ignores the fact that medical gac has one of the lowest regret rates out there and is extremely successful.

It says to look for external factors like ADHD or Autism, like either of thoes would change the gender incongruence?? Like yeah, lots of trans people are neurdivergent, but that changes nothing since u can't ""cure"" neurdivergence and gac is still proven to work ridiculously well in helping trans people, regardless of neurological wiring. Then it claims that, because of bullying and transphobia, kids should be discouraged from socially transitioning. ""Hey kids, are you sick of being bullied?? Well why don't you change your name and build a new life for yourself!"" Like are you seriously gonna victim blame on an actual medical report like it isn't people like YOU (Dr Hilary Cass) who encourage that bullying and transphobia!

Even ignoring all of that, it still takes seriously concerns that pretty much all major Western medical organisations know to be false. Like the idea that trans kids don't exist. The document that is supposed to be helping trans kids, humouring the idea that they don't exist. It's such a translucent exercise of cis-superiority that would be generous to imply arrogance and alleviate any malice intent from the equation. It gives a platform to bigots to stand on ""don't believe me, well in section 12:14 of the Cass Review it clearly states...(some dribble about social transitioning being wrong)."" I saw a tweet from a JK Rowling fan saying that the cast need to apologise to her for their remarks in support of the trans community and she responded (roughly) ""I wouldn't accept it."" THEY WERE RIGHT!! JK deserves no apology from anyone, but now she has a government approved document to validate her bigotry.

What scariest of all is how close we are to being a genuinely unsafe country for trans people. How many kids are gonna kill themselves because of this review? How many people are going to be assaulted and beaten up because of this document?? Last time rishi made a joke about trans people hate crime towards trans people took a significant rise in the UK, I dread to see what's gonna happen because of this. "

AM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

Then, I alternate between

2. NIOD GHKCU - Keen for a more potent version of this 

Or

3. Timeless 20% Vitamin C Ferulic Acid Vitamin C – When I used TO vitamin C powder at night I used to see a wee difference in my complextion when I woke up but with this I don’t so wondering if anyone can recommend something better that isnt TO- as I didnt like the texture and cba with the mixing.

4. La Roche Psay Invisible fluid - guess this is fine for now but would love to know of tinted sun creams that are good for pale, cool undertoned skin. 

 PM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

5. Dermatica tretinoin 0.015%/Niacinamide 4% Azelaic Acid 4% Every second night with 1 weeks break before and after microneedling 

On the nights I am not using Tret I use the 2. NIOD or 3. Timeless depending on what I used in the morning 

5. Dermatica ceramide and peptide moisturiser - keen to swap this out as it seems over priced for what it is 

Once a week or once every fortnight a TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution depending on microneedling healing stage 

Microneedle approx once a month following the Pen Smit protocol 

Concerns in order of priority:

Pinkish, purple under eye circles which are often puffy, particularly on the right side. I’ve had these for as long as I can remember and am almost accepting that blepharoplasty is probably the only intervention that will remove them. Until I can afford surgery ( I live I the UK) I really hope that microneedling and RLT help reduce them and think I should also look into whether underlying health issues or allergys could be contributing to them but find it quite overwhelming and not really sure where best to start, what tests to prioritse, how long I would have to exclude something or say, take allergy meds to know… Wow they really get me down like I look SO sick and I dream of feeling comfortable make up free. 

Redness under nose, like a pink moustache that isnt particularly textured beyond what you would expect from spots. Have had this for as long as I can remember, wonder if it is from blowing my nose in the cold frequently (used to skate) or from a steroid cream I v vaguely remember being prescribed something.

General uneven looking complexion – blotchy, spots take ages to fade and up close you can see that my skin is soooo congested, I have white heads, black heads, pustules pretty much everywhere apart from my jaw. Possibly mild rosacea type 2 which might be why I randomly got blepharitus which is now reacurring. Not figured that out yet, god so much is up! Though I came for product recommendations I am also wondering if there are there any Derms or aestheticians that would let me DM them some photos? I feel like I need to show my face in its entirety both up close and selfie distance in various lights to get a good idea of what my skin is like and some features I have are pretty identifiable and though the changes are slim I would be mortified if someone I know saw them.

&#x200B;

Anyway, back to the main reason I am posting - 

 I was considering these products linked below which are a bit out of budget and not easy to get hold of as I am not US based and got stuck on whether the added kojic acid and alpha arbutin in [Brightening Tranexamic Acid Treatment – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/multi-bright-tranexamic-acid-treatment-5?_pos=1&_sid=0bb9e1337&_ss=r) would be an issue with GHKCU and the Tret 

and then when I considered  [Tranexamic Acid Serum – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/tranexamic-topical-acid-5?_pos=2&_sid=8227fd551&_ss=r)  with the added kojic acid and niacinamide gathered that I couldnt use this with vitamin C but got stuck on whether it would be ok following GHKCU / Tret"

But I'm not opposed to the occasional night out, whether it's hitting the town or just taking a stroll. I'm caring, understanding, and have a quirky sense of humour. Born in the UK, I've spent my entire life here, and I'm of mixed race.

I'm seeking someone who can be themselves around me, emotionally available for both serious discussions and light-hearted banter. I'm a big gamer/nerd and would love to connect with someone who shares my passion for online games, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, etc.

I'm looking for a long-term, monogamous relationship. Please don't reach out if you're already in a relationship. Age and body type aren't dealbreakers for me, as long as we vibe and you're close in age.

If interested, feel free to send me a message, and let's see where it takes us!"

I am close to waiving the white flag. I'm not one to call on the Universe for signs, but it sure feels like I'm not meant for the UK.

**Timeline:**

* Route: Ancestry Visa
* (Canadian) via my Paternal Grandparents
* Applied: Feb 1
* Biometrics: Feb 6
* Email 1 for additional information: Feb 19
* Email 2 for additional information: March 4
* Email 3 for additional information: March 18
* **Final decision refusal: March 28**
* Complaint submitted: April 2
* **Complaint not upheld: April 11**

**Refusal: ""***As above you did not respond to our emails requesting further information and you have not provided sufficient evidence that confirms the UK Ancestry link to your claimed grandparent.*""

https://preview.redd.it/r0j3b6okwutc1.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7cdd6187a2d15dd119c956f675f58aa8c90a096

**Birth Certificate:**

The letter states that I provided my ""Paternal Grandfathers death certificate."" 

I did not provide my grandfather's death certificate. The document is my father's birth certificate, whose middle name is my grandfather's first name. So I wondered if, at a quick glance, the assumption was that this document was of my grandfather. There is a deceased watermark on the document. I wonder if that, coupled with the similar names, resulted in a mixup. 

I will add that this document also clearly shows the names of my father's parents and has a large ""Birth Certificate"" title at the top. Not Death Certificate.

&#x200B;

**No Communication:**

In the emails asking for additional information, it was never mentioned that I provided my grandfather's death certificate. Only that they were not satisfied that I had provided enough evidence of an ancestral link. So, I assumed the original Birth Certificate was not sufficient. Thus, I gathered additional documents: **Act of Birth (long-form birth certificate),  Birth Certificate (original that I submitted), Baptismal Papers and my Grandparent's Marriage Certificate.**

The letter states that no communication was received in their attempts to follow up with me. This is untrue. I responded with the documents on the following dates:

**Email 1: March 1**

I sent an email to: [WorkNonSponsored.DocsRequested@fco.gov.uk](mailto:WorkNonSponsored.DocsRequested@fco.gov.uk) and received a confirmation auto-response of receipt.

**Email 2: March 24**

In response to an email stating that they still haven't heard from me, I replied to the email directly with the same information as provided on March 1. 

&#x200B;

**Complaint:** 

**April 2:** I submitted a complaint through the online form and directly to: [complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk](mailto:complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk)

The form did not allow me to provide an attachment, so I emailed with a very clear timeline, my documents, screenshots of my emails, and proof that they were received with the auto-email confirmation.

**April 11: Complaint not upheld**

https://preview.redd.it/ubwscn740vtc1.png?width=2076&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c5a3e0523e0fd93e9d658d3cf6f912ce44a92f2

Is my only option to apply for an administrative review? I do not have the option of waiting for a year. I also submitted my application before the new IHS increase, so re-applying means I will be paying a lot more. 

What I find frustrating is no one has addressed my points. All this complaint email reply confirms is that I've been refused. I feel like I am being forced to pay for a review. At this point, I would almost be happy if someone truly looked at my application and stated that they are rejecting me based on all of my evidence. 

Any advice or honest feedback, especially if there is a step where I've gone wrong, is appreciated. Feeling quite defeated..."

Some questions are about manipulation that may be triggering.

The idea; My idea is a 1st person POV (point of view) of being manipulated. I plan on taping my phone to my head or something like that, so you see directly what my eyes see. I only want to interact with animations instead of real objects (making animations on top of the real world and interacting with them only). Please make your own suggestions if you think of any suggestions or ideas.

I want to make manipulators for different kinds of relationships (e.g., work relationships, friends, strangers, teachers and family. Though, I plan on adding a stalker (if I have time)). I want to give each manipulator a different art style (e.g., claymation, traditional art, papermation, etc.) I would appreciate it if you could participate in my survey; thank you in advance :)

It's supposed to be a review on how the uk handles trans kids and adolescence in light of the recent Bell v Tavistock case. The problem is Dr Hilary Cass has a clear prejudice that she pours into her work and gets approval from other abhorrent people such as the PM Rishi Sunak or JK Rowling. The biggest fear I have with it is that its already making a difference, there are already calls for several NHS GIC's to close and reevaluate how they interact with patient care for trans youths. Its genuinely concerning because it doesn't just pick out trams children, but now anyone under 25. We're slipping down this hill straight into the jaws of a genocide and it's terrorfying.

When reading the review, it paints itself put to be a review designed to protect kids. It then goes on to say we don't know enough about puberty blockers to deem them safe (despite the fact that we do and still perscribe them to cis kids). Like it straight up ignores 50 years of reaserch on something that has been proven safe and is still administerd other children in a similar vein. It goes on to talk about how the human brain isn't fully developed until you're 25, so we should make the system harder for people under 25 to prevent any mistakes. Like this just blatantly ignores the fact that medical gac has one of the lowest regret rates out there and is extremely successful.

It says to look for external factors like ADHD or Autism, like either of thoes would change the gender incongruence?? Like yeah, lots of trans people are neurdivergent, but that changes nothing since u can't ""cure"" neurdivergence and gac is still proven to work ridiculously well in helping trans people, regardless of neurological wiring. Then it claims that, because of bullying and transphobia, kids should be discouraged from socially transitioning. ""Hey kids, are you sick of being bullied?? Well why don't you change your name and build a new life for yourself!"" Like are you seriously gonna victim blame on an actual medical report like it isn't people like YOU (Dr Hilary Cass) who encourage that bullying and transphobia!

Even ignoring all of that, it still takes seriously concerns that pretty much all major Western medical organisations know to be false. Like the idea that trans kids don't exist. The document that is supposed to be helping trans kids, humouring the idea that they don't exist. It's such a translucent exercise of cis-superiority that would be generous to imply arrogance and alleviate any malice intent from the equation. It gives a platform to bigots to stand on ""don't believe me, well in section 12:14 of the Cass Review it clearly states...(some dribble about social transitioning being wrong)."" I saw a tweet from a JK Rowling fan saying that the cast need to apologise to her for their remarks in support of the trans community and she responded (roughly) ""I wouldn't accept it."" THEY WERE RIGHT!! JK deserves no apology from anyone, but now she has a government approved document to validate her bigotry.

What scariest of all is how close we are to being a genuinely unsafe country for trans people. How many kids are gonna kill themselves because of this review? How many people are going to be assaulted and beaten up because of this document?? Last time rishi made a joke about trans people hate crime towards trans people took a significant rise in the UK, I dread to see what's gonna happen because of this. "

I have two tables:

Table 1: A list of all jobs and their locations (UK Postcodes). Table 2: A list of my consultants and their home addresses (UK Postcodes).

I've already created two map visuals. The visual on the left is made from Table 1, and the visual on the right is from Table 2. It's a report for operations management to assess whether we have enough cover for upcoming jobs next year or if we need to hire more consultants in certain areas with high demand for upcoming jobs.

 What I want to do is be able to click on a job on the left visual (Table 1) and then filter the right visual (Table 2) to show all consultants within a 100-mile radius. How do I achieve this?

I get not talking to the police in case you say something incriminating but to refuse to answer basic questions like ""do you understand?"" and ""are you ok?"" was very weird.

I originally took it to be Ruby taking Jodi/lawyers advice to the extreme however when watching a video on YouTube (for the life of me I cannot remember which one - there have been so many) that went into the timeline of what happened and where everyone was, something struck me. The video included all the 911 operators calls and how she coordinated it all. When they worked out who R's mother was, they said the only thing they had on file for her was a driving offense recently.

Whoever did the video then included the bodycam footage of that traffic stop and Ruby behaves in a similar way, barely speaking actually barely looking at the officer. 

Anyone shed any light on this behaviour? Or is this normal for people to behave in the US towards police officers? (I'm UK based)

Currently 19 and live in the UK but I have dual citizenship with lots of family across many states in the US I could live with temporarily while I got on my feet. 

But overall, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd assume the work is similar / the same and pays relatively similar. I'd also really appreciate some insight on positives and negatives of this trade in the US as where I am in the UK it has felt like 70% of the day is spent in the van between jobs in traffic especially on maintenance & repair side of things, which is something I wouldn't miss if it's any different in the US. 

I would appreciate any advice on what to do and anything I should avoid taking this career path. Thanks :)"

2024-04-11 15:25:30,Rebooking Drew McIntyre's WWE Championship Reigns (Part 3:Second Reign),1,1c1hv8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybooking/comments/1c1hv8h/rebooking_drew_mcintyres_wwe_championship_reigns/,0,1712849130.0,"After his victory against AJ Styles at Wrestlemania 37, Drew McIntyre looks to move on from his feuds with established stars, looking to showcase rising talent in his reign. However, his first challenge is from a former WWE Champion, Sheamus, who doesn't win the United States Championship in this universe. After winning the Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal at Wrestlemania, Sheamus wins a fatal four-way also involving Bobby Lashley, Braun Strowman and The Miz. Instead of getting too directly involved with McIntyre, Sheamus focuses on winning matches and proving himself as a viable challenger. During these matches, McIntyre seems to be scouting Sheamus, going on commentary and watching at ringside. At Backlash, the two men beat the piss out of each other. At one point, Drew McIntyre breaks Sheamus' nose with an elbow. The ending comes when the champion reverses White Noise into a Future Shock, and hits a Claymore for the victory.

In between Backlash and Hell In A Cell, Drew McIntyre has 2 championship defenses in NXT and NXT UK, against Tommaso Ciampa and Ilja Dragunov, further cementing his intent on showing off younger stars. He obviously retains both times, yet comes very close to losing both times. Ciampa gets a near-fall with an Air Raid Siren off the top rope, while Dragunov gets a near fall with a H-Bomb and the Torpedo Moscow.

On Raw, Drew McIntyre has begun a feud with Aleister Black, who has been undefeated since turning heel in November. He beats Kevin Owens in a #1 contenders match, and plays mind games with McIntyre in the build, even threatening his family. At Hell In A Cell, it is again a match where both men beat the piss out of each other. Both men are continuing to brawl, when Black goes for the Black Mass, which McIntyre ducks and hits the Claymore. The champion goes for the cover and Black somehow kicks out. The challenger gets on his knees, wanting McIntyre to hit another Claymore. He does it, goes for the cover, and wins. 

Going into Money In The Bank, McIntyre returns to his feud with The Club, now with Finn Balor who has returned from NXT. Despite this, Kevin Owens becomes #1 contender for the WWE Championship by defeating Styles clean, planting the seeds for The Club's break-up. In the build, Owens and McIntyre have to form an uneasy alliance to battle The Club, who keep meddling in their affairs. At Money In The Bank, The Club continue to get involved, at one point inadvertantly helping Kevin Owens stay in the match by putting his foot on the rope after the champion goes for the cover after a Claymore. Towards the end of the match, The Club attempt to get involved physically, yet Owens and McIntyre fight them off. When they finally clear them, the challenger goes for the Stunner when the champion's back is turned, yet McIntyre pushes him off and hits a Claymore for the victory. After the match, The Club attack both men, and Finn Balor holds up the WWE Championship, with AJ Styles looking on in envy.

Towards Summerslam, Drew McIntyre is caught up in the ongoing civil war within The Club. A 16-man #1 contenders tournament is made for the night after Money In The Bank to determine the WWE Championship challenger. AJ Styles beats Bobby Lashley and Finn Balor beats Kofi Kingston to make a Club final. In the final, Luke Gallows immediately punch both men at the same time, leading to a no-contest. After the match, Finn Balor states that it was their plan all along to get to the final and make it a no-contest, leading to a triple threat match being made for Summerslam. The following week on Raw, Drew McIntyre defeats AJ Styles in a rematch from Wrestlemania after Finn Balor accidentally costs his friend the match. Finn Balor attempts to help Styles up after the match, yet is shoved to the ground. The following week, Finn Balor defeats Drew McIntyre. On the go-home show, Balor and Styles, who are still not on great terms, battle against Drew McIntyre and a mystery partner. This mystery partner turns out to be Jinder Mahal, partly reuniting 3MB. McIntyre and Mahal win after Finn Balor accidentally hits Styles with a Shotgun Dropkick, leading to McIntyre hitting Styles with a Claymore to pin him and get the win. At Summerslam, Balor and Styles attempt to get along and take out McIntyre, and it works originally when they put him through the announce table with a Phenomenal Forearm. Inevitably however, it falls apart, and the men battle it out for 10 minutes. After a Double Clothesline, both men are down, and McIntyre regains the advantage. He is about to win the match with a Claymore, yet Gallows and Anderson come out and attack the champion. Styles and Balor join in, and after a 1916 on a chair, McIntyre is rendered out of the match completely. After this, it looks like the two challengers are going to be able to finish their battle. However, Gallows, Anderson and Balor turn to Styles, and beat the shit out of him. Gallows and Anderson hit the Magic Killer, and Balor hits two Coup De Grace's to win the match and the WWE Championship, turning on his best friend."

So far I've:
- washed the plant in the shower with plain water (preserving the soil because I don't have any to replace it with)
- I trimmed away (or pulled out) the brown crunchy dried leaves and stems
- with advice I made a dish soap, isopropyl alcohol and water mix in a spray bottle that I doused my plant with for a few days then did it less regularly like once a week ish because I was scared
- recently I put dish soap on a tissue and gave the leaves wipe to remove the white flakes I found on the leaves and the grown brown scales on others

When I got the plant, after trimming the green leaves were almost fully green but some of the tips of the leaves had browned and dried out. I'm noticing now that some of the previously fully green leaves are losing their green pigment and turning brown throughout. In fact, I'm noticing one of the new leaves that hasn't fully unfurled is turning brown too which is why I'm scared.

This is my first plant and I don't know what to do. I'm based in the UK for reference - I'd love some help on what this looks like to you and if you think I can save it please 🙏🏼 I'm hoping there's an ""easy"" way to save it.

Thank you xo
PS: there's one weird bunched up leaf in the last picture. It's been a few weeks and it hasn't opened up like some of the other new leaves. I'm thinking to cut it off? Thoughts?"
2024-04-11 15:24:41,Wake-On-Lan your SteamDeck: a full guide and caveats,1,1c1hujf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1c1hujf/wakeonlan_your_steamdeck_a_full_guide_and_caveats/,0,1712849081.0,"Recently I have been trying to get wake-on-lan (WOL) working on my LCD steamdeck with JSAUX dock. There has been many issues I have encountered, so I decided to summarize here so others can benefit.

**Why:**
* I want to play my steam library on my phone through steam link.


**Limitations:**

* You need a dock with Ethernet capability. Mine is [JSAUX 6-in-1 docking station](https://jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck).
* Easier to work with local network. If you want to do WOL over the internet, you need to setup port forwarding yourself, or configure a VPN (such as tailscale) to redirect your connection to one of your active computer/server in your home
* Steam is not officially supporting this feature. So it might break on future update.
* Do it at your own risk. Although everything I do is relatively safe, do not run commands from internet if you dont know what it will does to your system. 

&#x200B;

**How to:**

1. Unlock the readonly mode and make a sudo account. Please refer to other guides to do so. To confirm, try to install the packages we will need for checking later.

&#8203;

    $ sudo pacman -S gnu-netcat 

2. Get the ethernet *interface,* IP address, *MAC address,* and *broadcast address.* In the example below, *enp4s0f3u1u4* is the interface, and 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx is my MAC address, 163.xxx.xxx.xx is my IP address, and 163.xxx.xxx.255 is my broadcast address

&#8203;

    $ ip a
    5: enp4sxxxxxx: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether 00:e0:xx:xx:xx:xx brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet 163.xxx.xxx.xx/xx brd 163.xxx.xxx.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp4s0f3u1u4

3. Enable the WOL feature of your network card. After querying ethtool interface, if Wake-on is ""d"", it means the feature is currently disabled. Then you need to set the value to ""g"". To make the changes persistent, please refer to the [archwiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wake-on-LAN).

&#8203;

    $ sudo ethtool enp4sxxxxxx | grep Wake-on
    
    Supports Wake-on: pumbag
    Wake-on: d
    
    $ sudo ethtool -s enp4sxxxxxx wol g

4. For the purpose of debugging, you can stop the firewall. It is not necessary for the WOL to works though. 

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl stop firewalld

5. Install a wake-on-lan application on your mobile phone, such as [this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.mrwebb.wakeonlan&hl=en&gl=US). Configure the MAC address, broadcast address, and IP address appropriately, and set WOL port to 9.
6. On your steamdeck, make sure firewall is disabled, and try to run the following command. While the command is running, try to press the send the WOL magic packet from your phone. If it works properly, then you will see some output on your steamdeck.

&#8203;

    $ sudo nc --udp --listen --local-port=9 --hexdump
    
    �������Lh��Lh��Lh��Lh����Lh��Lh�.... Received 102 bytes from the socket
    00000000  FF FF FF FF  FF FF 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  ........Lh....Lh
    00000010  17 E3 00 E0  4C 68 17 E3  00 E0 4C 68  17 E3 00 E0  ....Lh....Lh....
    ...

7. If the previous part is working, congratulation, you can try to sleep your steamdeck and send the magic package from your phone to wake it up. Now you can reenable your firewall

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld

8. But, you might notice that, after the deck is sleeping for >15s, it will no longer wake up the deck. It leads to the second part to modify the ethernet power management. 
9. First, we need to find the appropriate usb devices for our ethernet. To do so, run lsusb. Try to list down all the ID for the Ethernet adapter, in my case, it's all the devices that starts with Realtek semiconductor, i.e. ""0bda:8153"", ""0bda:0411"", ""0bda:5411""

&#8203;

    $ sudo lsusb
    
    Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 003 Device 003: ID 13d3:3553 IMC Networks Bluetooth Radio
    Bus 003 Device 002: ID 28de:1205 Valve Software Steam Controller
    Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 0bda:8153 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8153 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter
    Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0bda:0411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. Hub
    Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
    Bus 001 Device 004: ID 3434:0311 Keychron Keychron V1
    Bus 001 Device 003: ID 17ef:60e4 Lenovo Lenovo Legion M300 RGB Gaming Mouse
    Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0bda:5411 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTS5411 Hub
    Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

10. The previous ID format is given as ""idVendor:idProduct"". We now need to find the appropriate driver for the those three usb devices. Run the following two commands, and pinpoint which usb devices corresponds to the IDs. 

&#8203;

    $ tail /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idVendor

11. Test to see if the WOL is working fine now. 
12. If it's working fine, you can make the changes persistent by writing a systemd service, as follows. Also after testing, turns out I dont need to enable ""1-1"" to make WOL work reliably.

&#8203;

    /etc/systemd/system/wol.service
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    [Unit]
    Description=Enable WOL usb
    Wants=network-pre.target
    After=network-pre.target NetworkManager.service

    Type=oneshot

    Restart=on-failure
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

13. Also, enable the unit.

&#8203;

    $ sudo systemctl enable wol.service

14. Profit! Enjoy your game by streaming to your deck from your mobile phone through Steam Link.

&#x200B;

**Caveats and TODOs:**

1. Only deck built in screen is turned on when turning on through WOL. If you have any suggestion how to turn on both displays, please let me know.
2. Haven't fully tested the systemd service yet."
2024-04-11 15:24:11,Ungrateful but I feel guilty if I stop doing what I should,1,1c1hu6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1c1hu6c/ungrateful_but_i_feel_guilty_if_i_stop_doing_what/,0,1712849051.0,"I have a narcissistic mom in her early 60's and I'm the youngest between me and my sister who is over a decade older than me.(30F,40F). From I've been 14 I've been helping with my mom's healthcare because she is diabetic etc. In my 20's I would be there mostly as her caregiver in the hospital and at home, sometimes financially when we would have to go to the hospital for an emergency and be there as emotional support.

Idk what but the caring mother I knew changed into a manipulative narcissistic character.

I'd realize growing up I would be labelled as the black sheep even though I always assisted heavily around the house everyday, followed rules but had my own bit of individuality I would be passionate about(piercings) but I always did well in school. I went through a traumatic situation that affected my university years and she would throw it in my face and call me mad(mentally unstable) even when she knows I am telling the truth. 

One time I told her something that another family member said about her and to get out of it, the person lied and tried to accuse me of making it up or being mad. My mother also berated me with those insults and say I must be mad. Later on, she found information confirming that I was telling the truth and never apologized. 

She also has a friend from the UK she knows from her childhood that she only talks about my older sister with and her kids. She never mentions any updates about me or good things with me.

We live in a family home(30F) with other family members but I take care of her daily. In our neighbourhood when we have an argument she would be on the top of her lungs calling me mental and making it seem to others as if I suffer from mental health issues. Quite a few people in the neighbourhood know me and she has no qualms embarassing me. In the country I live there are severe negative connotations and stigma associated with mental health issues and alot of people who suffer from this disease are met with violence.

At this point, this is one of the things she constantly says on the top of her voice. Living in a neighbourhood where people can easily hear this and spread gossip, I believe she chooses to do this to me because no matter what I always come back and help her and speak to her. Whereby with my older sister, she couldnt do or say half of these things to her without significant repercussions or my sister deciding to not speak with her again or allow her to see her children. 

I hate toxicity and even though I have my flaws I hate that I have to be consistently berated, attacked and embarassed but feel guilty if I put my foot down and stop caring for her. I dont deserve this treatment and its crazy because everybody else sees her as a nice sweetheart but she has some terrible narcissistic traits that are hurtful. 

She throws rocks and hides her hands and no matter what I do for her, sacrifice for her... its never enough.

I put studying last, classes, things I have to do JUST so I can be able to care for her and give her the things she needs to be comfortable. I put myself 2nd or last but I seem to be the most hated.

I even get blamed for situations where I am the victim and didnt do anything to deserve it. 

So my question is, should I just move out and cut all ties or stay a little longer(by the end of the year) and let them know I will be moving out by then so they can arrange other plans?

My mental health is declining because of how I am being treated and I cannot continue to allow this anymore. I am deeply hurt and keep getting hurt in every corner of my life.

I left out alot of details but I have always been there with my mother through thick and thin and even though my older sister is in a better financial position than I at the moment I always try to do the best that I can.

I hope someone understands me at the very least. I'm not putting myself as this woe is me character ...I dont have any issues having my mother as the biggest priority in my life but shes very disrespectful and hurtful too many times and I dont think I can continue to take it.

I bought an unused tube of Melamet off Vinted and I started using it (just on the upper lip area) last year. I probably only used it consistently for 2 weeks in the evening, and I was really careful in the sunlight afterward (factor 50!) It faded this winter (I’m UK-based) but then I started using Glycolic Acid toner consistently to help with my hormonal acne. Whilst it helped a lot with the acne, it’s now made my hyperpigmentation worse! I’ve been reading all the risks about hydroquinone and I don’t want to use it again I( was stupid for even using it in the first place).

Do you think I’ve done any damage by using it for that brief period, and what safe alternatives are there to help minimise fade the tan-mustache?! "

What I'm looking for. A diverse, active and friendly club with keelboat sailing for me, and (eventually) dinghy instruction for my infant.

All the clubs I've found so far are either barely active, disorganised, on bits of the Hudson that don't look particularly fun to sail on or essentially social clubs.

The biggest in the area seems Nyack. But any others I should check out?

Myself and my partner are preparing our application for an Unmarried Partner Family Visa - and were hoping to get some advice from the community at large - after a vary underwhelming encounter with an immigration firm we were hoping to use - who doesn't seem to be up on the latest UKVI changes etc.   


I am originally from the US and have been in the UK for 3 years as of next week, on a student visa which expires in early May. My partner is a British citizen, and we have been together in a relationship for 2 years 1 month, and living together for 2 years.   


We have lived together at 2 different addresses within the UK and have an array of documents to prove this in each of our names, as well as joint documents.   


We also have some photos and letters of support from UK family and friends regarding our relationship - so I am not concerned about the relationship or cohabitation aspects of the application.   


The reason we have been seeking out professional advice in the first place, was that my partner was let go from his employer in Feb 2024, just as we were gearing up to start our application. He had been with that employer for nearly 2 years, making £75k and we have all of those payslips + bank statements.  


He found a new job shortly after being let go, at the same salary - but his start date at the new job is not until the 29th of April. We have the settlement agreement from the old employer, the offer letter from the new employer etc as well.   


My partner also receives PIP so this makes us exempt from meeting the standard requirement, and needing to show adequate maintenance instead.   


As far as I know, you can combine PIP + income to show this - and when combined with his salary in relation to our housing costs (rent and council tax) we more than meet adequate maintenance   


But I am not sure if or how the slight ""gap"" in payslips will impact us - or if it will, given we had ""income"" from the settlement agreement from the old employer and there is a new job offer on the table at the same salary level.   


I am not sure how to frame this in a cover letter, or what/how much financial documents to show - and after speaking to the basically useless immigration firm - I am now confused as to whether we can apply now - or need to wait for him to actually ""start"" the new job.   


 I have finished my degree and have the right to work full time on my current visa until it expires, as a student who has finished their degree - and I also have an offer letter for a job which I start soon and which will provide an additional amount of salary - if that is useful as well.   


At this point, other than knowing which financial documents to send, if we are still able to - as well as how or if this gap will impact us - I would rather handle this myself if at all possible - as all other aspects of the application are straight forward, and I like to be in control of matters like tis as well as aware of all correspondence - as opposed to letting someone who may do a bad job - try to do it for me.   


I would really appreciate any help or advice. Thanks so much!

This, of course, is absolutely nuts. So I called the Customs Broker phone line, and they told me the declared value was showing as $2550. This makes no sense to me. I saw there is a dispute button, but I threw away the packaging weeks ago, so I really have no evidence to prove my case. Is there anyone specific I should contact or anything to do to prove this wrong or bring up in a dispute? It will only let me type 80 characters, which isn't even enough for a full sentence."

I am a beginner tinwhistle player but advanced enough so that I started feeling limitations of the cheapest whistles: I've got a Feadog in D but the higher half of the higher octave is so unreliable and poor (too airy) sounding that it often limits me in playing.
I've found a guy who has four used whistles to sell, all in nice condition and reasonable prices. All in D so I am trying to convince myself there is no reason (other than GAS) to buy more than one. Maybe two if there is a reasonable explanation (like totally different sound or something).  
The four models I am choosing between are:
- Tony Dixon DX004   (https://www.tonydixonmusic.co.uk/product/soprano-whistle-key-of-d-4/)  
- Tony Dixon DX204D   (https://reverb.com/uk/item/12021977-dixon-solid-brass-d-whistle-dx204d)  
- Killarney Nickel   (https://mcneelamusic.com/wind/killarney-nickel-d-whistle/)  
- Goldfinch   (https://goldfinch.eu/pl/whistles/flazolet-high-d-goldfinch/)  
  
Which one (or maybe more than one?) should I choose and why?  
What is important to me? Ease of playing as I am still on my learning curve. ;)  
I've looked for reviews and sound samples online but this didn't solve my problem: I like the sound of every one of them (and it's really hard to tell the true sound from YT videos) and I haven't found any obvious reason to choose one over other ones.  
Please help me, share your recommendations, things I should know or anything that can help me choose. ;)   
And please, don't tell me ""buy them all"". I am trying to fight GAS, not feed it!  
Thanks!"

As the title suggests, I'm constantly tired. No matter how much sleep I get, I'm tired the entire day. My blood tests come back fine, so my doctor is saying nothing is wrong.

The thing is, this started around July 2023, progressively getting worse. I'm constantly battling fatigue, headaches, slight blurry vision in my right eye, and get more pins & needles in my arms and legs than I used to. I drink plenty of water during the day, I hit enough calories but still this is happening. 

What concerns me is that I can't check for swollen lymph nodes in my arm pits, as I had chest masculinisation surgery in 2021 and have no feeling in my chest/armpit area at all. 

Before all this started, I had a lot of energy but now I struggle to do anything but sleep.

I've been on testosterone injections (prescribed) since the start of 2023, and get injected every 10 weeks by my doctor. 

I'm really at a loss as to what is going on."

Thank you to all who have participated in the survey so far, your input has been a great help. Just doing a 2nd wave of promotion for the study to try an increase the sample size.

I'm a final year undergraduate student on a live production based course. I am conducting a study as part of my dissertation which is aimed towards live sound engineers and touches on the topic of sound restrictions.

If you would like to participate in the study please use the following link:

https://linktr.ee/jakedaysound

The aim is to identify some of the most influential effects that sound restrictions have on the performance of live sound engineers, both positive and negative, as well as get broad feedback on how engineers can work more effectively under said restrictions.

I am very thankful to anybody who participates in the study and would like you all to know that this would help me out a great deal.

If you have any questions about the study I will be happy to answer them at the following email address: jd1741@my.acm.ac.uk

Thanks again and I hope you all have a grand day!

Huel seems fantastic to me because in my case the convenience is undeniably very helpful. Plus ADHD is the worst thing ever for meal planning and I like to be able to scale up/down my meals.

Huel is marketed as a meal replacement and a lot of people for drawn to it for losing weight. But in my case I need to gain a bit or maintain and I'm trying to hit the NHS 2500 calorie recommendation as that is roughly close to my baseline. The obvious solution is ""scoop more you idiot"" but the costs do seem to rise quite quickly. I might be wrong though as I am very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel.

Generally I make my own overnight oats and have them in the morning for breakfast plus a banana and tea which is about 547 kcal. Then lets have a hot & savory meal at lunch for 400 kcal, and then a hot and savory meal for dinner for another 400 kcal. I'll add on 120 kcal extra for the odd snack/tea. This totals at 1467 kcal so we're still 1033 kcal short of 2500. For those meals I'd need about 9 bags and it will cost around £167.40 (£2.65/meal) or £150.66 with student/NHS discount (£2.39/meal)

Some people have suggested using 3 scoops so we'll try that as well. 547 kcal for breakfast, 600 Huel H&S (Lunch), 600 Huel H&S (Dinner), and after adding on 120 kcal you get 1867 so still 633 kcal short of 2500. Going by my bad maths I'd need about 13 bags of Huel H&S at £223.20 (£3.98/meal) or £217.62 with student/NHS discount (£3.58/meal).

Then lets try add in one Huel Black drink per day at 400 kcal which totals at 2278 kcal (362 short of 2500). This would be about £298.80 (£3.16/meal) or £268.92 with student/NHS discount (£2.84/meal).

So assuming I haven't made any horrible errors in my maths £2.84/meal still is pretty damn good. £268.92 seems expensive but for a month of food it might not even be that bad (again very likely underestimating the hidden costs of the average UK diet when comparing it to Huel). I think what I might do is buy a 20kg bag of basmati rice and throw it in the rice cooker which should boost the calories much higher and cheaper which I can combine with the Huel meals. Or throw in some naan bread etc. Huel is still great and it's definitely better than my standard diet both in nutrition and cost regardless."

My online reseach brought up many terms that I couldnt understand and I kept getting lost rabbit holes of looking what words mean.  
My questions are:

1) What is the difference between all the different methods of SRS, I know there is vaginoplasty and vulvoplasty, but I don't know what is what, as I said, I don't know anything. 

2) Is there any risks that I should worry about in each method (anything goes here, can be from ones that are common, to ones that are rare, however please catagorize them)

3) How good is the functionality of each method (like Q2, please catogorize them)

4) After SRS when can I start doing everything again? Ie having sex, being able to swim in chlorinated water, showering ect ect.

5) Any clinic in the UK anyone that anyone reccomend with pricing ranges, that would be helpful."

They started blowing up sometimes last year, and people always say because people ""expressing themselves or finding themselves"" mate how is your past life ""you"" if its not your current life but a past life?? Like that logic itself contradicts itself as well. It's awfully weird how literally 99 percent of therians are stuff like a fox or a dog or a cat but never something like an microorganism or an centipede. If therians are valid why are most of them cats or foxes etc and there's like barely ever any centipedes or ants. Like a lot more centipedes and ants have been killed when compares to cats lmao.They speak about shifts but then you have to wonder to yourself if they are pretending / convinced themseleves or if they have another mental disorder. I wouldn't attack a therian or hurt them or whatnot but I just can't wrap my head around it. I've sat and done research on research but therians are just contradicting themselves.
Some therians say ""we dont believe we were animals in our past life we believe we are spiritually connected"" and some say ""we only believe we were animals in our past lives"" now what does your past life have to do with your current life?? You can't remember what you had for breakfast a week ago but remember a whole ass past life?? Man wtf

Now according to the ny post:

**""Other research, conducted by Helen Clegg of the UK's University of Northampton, suggests that some therians may have higher levels of schizotypy, or schizotypal personality disorder. STPD is a condition marked by intense discomfort with social interactions and personal relationships""**

The same people who are therians today hated on the weird human collie dude a few years ago??? 

Physical transformation is impossible now there's no evidence but that belief. If you were an animal in your past life and have shifts etc why don't you eat your family and eat your pets or some shit?? Lmao


They experience species dysphoria too which is linked to other mental illnesses.

Interesting how most therians have a mental illness or struggle with depression or anxiety (which is also linked with species dysphoria)

Can't you just link zoanthropy to therianthropy??

2024-04-11 15:05:48,Question for anyone who fenced before 1987 - Turning your back in the 1980s,3,1c1he6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fencing/comments/1c1he6o/question_for_anyone_who_fenced_before_1987/,0,1712847948.0,"I've gone on deep dive into the History of the turning your back rule. The earliest reference to turning your back not being allowed I could find was:

>There are a variety of other bad customs equally deserving of reprehension as becoming a genteel fencer; such, for example, as crying out after every thrust , and turning their back upon their adversary when too much or too closely pressed by him, either for the purpose of arresting his impetuosity or frustrating his design, or to get it decided whether or not his stance of which thrust was irregularly given, when he not been able to keep it off in the impulsion .

>Turning the back in this manner, either through imprudence or custom in a serious affair, is very justly condemned, for, could such a circumstance who might, be alleged in excuse for being wrongfully touched, if the fencer so turning his back were to receive a thrust owing to his having irregularly defended himself?

The Modern Art of Fencing 1822, pg 215-216:

https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Modern_Art_of_Fencing/d38w2eHuaVYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA216&printsec=frontcover

Which feels very similar to the idea that turning your back is unfair because it causes a halt.

So then I traced forward through various rulebooks. The AFLA rules from the late 1800s are all very sparse, and it's quite clear that they don't intend to cover all circumstances ([Roughly 20 rules in total](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1891.pdf)) so there's no mention of turning.

But then as I trace up through the [1940s rules](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1940.pdf), up to the [1970s](http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AFLA-Rules-1974.pdf), they all have something to this effect:

> In foil and sabre such movements as the displacement of the target, side-stepping, turns and half-turns, are permitted, but the reversal of positions on the strip is forbidden. Therefore, if the original positions are actually reversed, the contestants shall be placed back in the positions which they occupied at the moment the reversing movement was begun.

-AFLA Rules from 1940

Which explicitly allows turning, and makes no mention of turning causing a halt.


*Weirdly as an somewhat related aside - the 1950 rules seem to allow epee fencers to pass each other and keep fencing, and end up on opposite sides*

> *Reversing of Positions. EPEE.*

> *Movements which result in the reversal of the 88 original positions of the competitors are allowed on condition that they are executed without jostling the opponent. . The reversed position is secured if the reversal is more than half executed when the president of the jury gives the order "" Halt.""*

The earliest I example of turning causing a halt or a Yellow card is the 1987 USFA rules

http://www.quarte-riposte.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/USFA-Rules-1987-with-Operations-Manual.pdf

----

So the question is - what the fuck? Could you completely turn your back without penalty before 1987? or was it just one of those conventions that caused a halt and never was explicitly written down until the 1980s?"

\- Deposit wasn't protected (Currently have a deposit not protected claim, [old thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1bhukxh/used_a_no_win_no_fee_solicitor_for_deposit_not/))  
\- They gave us a section 21 notice and then withdrew it after we told them it's not valid. 

The property in question has been neglected by the landlord. It's had no gas safety certificate for years, boiler was replaced recently by landlord when the last gas safety failed (our lives were at risk from it according to the gas safety engineer due to products of combustion). House has mould everywhere. My mum had to call the police after being pushed hard by the landlord on one occasion (She's nearly 70 and has trouble walking as is), she was sympathetic decided not to pursue charges, we just don't allow landlord visits now unless it's for safety reasons (gas safety, etc). My mum does plan to move from here but I've told her to drag out the process until the local housing allowance is raised in 2025 hopefully, as my mum is disabled/doesn't work and rent is unaffordable in London at this point. 

I posted a thread about this back here:

**So fast forward to today, we've received a letter from the agency that the rent will increase from next month, are we fine to just ignore it and continue paying the same rent?** We did this before when they asked us previously, we just ignored it. It wasn't a Section 13 rent increase form, which I think it needs to be on, it's it's just a few lines of text on a piece of paper that they will increase it. We're happy for them to go through the Section 21 process but from what I understand they can never issue the Section 21 now since the deposit wasn't originally protected and since there's no gas safety cert?

Hi everyone and thanks for clicking!

I'm from the UK, 36, and I'm retired. I have a law degree I basically got just for a challenge, and I want to go back to university soon. 

I'm really into video games, especially sim racing, VR, emulated stuff, but everything really. From AAA titles to indie games, across most genres.

I'm very into music, I play a bit of ukulele and guitar, make beats sometimes, and have a pretty wide range I listen to. Mostly rap but anything and everything. 

I love keeping fit, train in a lot of different sports including basketball, football, tennis, etc. I also cycle, play darts, pool and poker, and love to cook. 

I'm working on a couple of projects, got a book or two in the works that are in semi-active development. "
2024-04-11 15:02:29,High Cost of Inconsistency of Prescription Cannabis: Navigating the Challenges,1,1c1hb70,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1c1hb70/high_cost_of_inconsistency_of_prescription/,0,1712847749.0,"#### Introduction

**In recent years, the United Kingdom has taken tentative steps towards recognizing cannabis for its medicinal properties, offering a glimmer of hope to those suffering from chronic pain and other debilitating conditions. However, this hope is frequently dimmed by the stark reality of inconsistent supply, leaving patients in a precarious limbo. This blog delves into the profound disappointment and pain felt by patients due to these supply issues, and examines the wider repercussions for legislative progress in the realm of prescription cannabis within the UK.**

#### The Emotional Toll of Inconsistent Supply

**For many patients, prescription cannabis is not a luxury; it’s a lifeline. The emotional toll of the supply’s inconsistency is profound. Imagine planning your life around a medication that can vanish from the pharmacy shelves without warning. Patients like Sarah (a pseudonym to protect privacy), who suffers from multiple sclerosis, describes the situation as “living on a seesaw,” where her ability to manage pain and maintain a semblance of normalcy is constantly in flux.**

**This inconsistency breeds not just disappointment but severe anxiety. Patients are left wondering not if, but when their supply will run out, forcing them into a cycle of stress that can exacerbate their conditions. Families watch helplessly as their loved ones grapple with the uncertainty, creating an additional emotional strain on already burdened households.**

#### Physical Consequences of Supply Disruptions

**The interruption in supply doesn’t just disrupt lives emotionally; it has tangible physical repercussions. When patients are forced to abruptly stop their cannabis-based treatments, the consequences can be dire. The return of chronic pain, the resurgence of seizures, and the increased intensity of symptoms can push patients back to square one, negating months or even years of progress.**

**Healthcare professionals, too, are caught in this dilemma. Doctors and nurses, who have seen the benefits of consistent treatment, find themselves unable to promise stability to their patients. Dr. Richardson, a pain specialist, highlights the frustration of “knowing what could help my patients, yet being powerless to assure them of continuous treatment.”**

#### Legislative Stagnation: A Barrier to Progress

**The journey of prescription cannabis in the UK is mired in legislative caution, a reflection of the complex global stance on cannabis. Despite evidence of its benefits, the inconsistency in supply has given lawmakers pause, slowing the momentum for further legalization and integration into the healthcare system. Critics argue that these supply issues serve as ammunition for opponents of prescription cannabis, complicating efforts to present it as a reliable and effective treatment option.**

**The impact of these supply inconsistencies extends beyond patient care; they shape the narrative around cannabis legislation. Lawmakers, faced with the challenge of ensuring a steady supply, may become hesitant to expand access, fearing the backlash from potential shortages. This hesitancy feeds into a vicious cycle, where legislative progress is stalled, further entrenching supply issues.**

#### The Ripple Effect on Healthcare and Society

**The ramifications of inconsistent cannabis supply ripple through the healthcare system and society. Healthcare providers, tasked with managing patient expectations and treatment plans, often find themselves at the mercy of supply chains they can’t control. This unpredictability can undermine the patient-provider trust relationship, crucial for effective care.**

**Moreover, societal perceptions of cannabis as a legitimate medical treatment are influenced by these supply issues. Public confidence in cannabis as a medical solution wanes with each report of shortages, affecting societal acceptance and potentially delaying wider recognition and use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes.**

**The economic impact is also significant. Patients, many of whom already face financial challenges due to their health conditions, may incur additional costs seeking alternative treatments. Healthcare providers, for their part, must navigate the administrative and financial burdens of managing an unreliable medication supply.**

#### Towards a Solution: Pathways and Possibilities

**Addressing the inconsistency in prescription cannabis supply requires a multifaceted approach. Firstly, regulatory changes could ease some of the barriers to a steady supply, such as restrictions on importation and cultivation. Developing domestic production capabilities is another avenue, potentially reducing reliance on international sources and making supply chains more resilient.**

**Advocacy plays a crucial role. Patient voices and their stories of how cannabis has transformed their lives are powerful tools in shaping public opinion and legislative action. By bringing these stories to the forefront, there’s an opportunity to influence policy and create a more supportive environment for prescription cannabis.**

**A collaborative effort among stakeholders—government bodies, healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, and the cannabis industry—is essential. Together, they can work towards creating a reliable, effective, and accessible prescription cannabis system in the UK.**

#### Conclusion

**The path to integrating prescription cannabis into the UK’s healthcare system is fraught with challenges, not least of which is the inconsistency in supply. This issue not only affects patients directly, causing disappointment and physical suffering, but also hampers legislative progress and has broader implications for healthcare and society. However, by acknowledging these challenges and working collaboratively towards solutions, there’s hope for a future where prescription cannabis is accessible to all who need it, marking a significant step forward in patient care and treatment options.**

2024-04-11 15:00:49,"""Journey into Reptilian Conspiracy Theories""",1,1c1h9mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/reptilians/comments/1c1h9mr/journey_into_reptilian_conspiracy_theories/,1,1712847649.0,"I've had quite a journey with the whole reptilian conspiracy thing. At one point, I was fully convinced that reptiles were secretly running the world, and their advanced capabilities made them untouchable. It felt like they were messing with my mind, but I eventually realized I might be showing signs of schizophrenia. Despite the crazy thoughts, I knew I didn't have to buy into them completely. I grounded myself and took control of the wild theories.

I've seen countless shape-shifting videos that just make you think, and I noticed all the low vibrational people that dumb it down instantly. Like, hello? So every single reptilian video is supposed to be a glitch? I was like, ""That's weird."" One day, I did a search filter and found a video posted the same day. It was a guy talking over a compilation of reptiles and their eyes flickering. The video was strange because I couldn't find it elsewhere. It was sort of funny; he had Tourette's, I'm sure, and he was swearing and acting like a crazy, manic man, screaming, ""They're real f\*\*king reptile f\*\*ks!"" I was in hysterics of laughter because of his reaction. But something interesting was his stutters of words saying, ""They're f\*kn real, just look at those f\*ks!"" I got you, reptile f\*ks. It was interesting because it was a lot of celebs in interviews, and I grew up with friends with Tourette's, and I know they just spit mostly their thoughts. I was like, ""This dude is onto something here.""

So I did more research about celebs and found some Justin Bieber clip of him shifting at a police interview. I remember watching like, ""Oh, I remember seeing this years ago!"" Like it was a psyops, the entire Justin Bieber was arrested drama. I'm like, ""Hmm, what is it, psyops?"" And this, so I'm like, ""Let's try connecting these dots."" Then there's Adele's supposed article that got taken/wiped from the web. People talking about seeing it, but over the years, it was mostly forgotten about. But apparently, she shifted at her concert backstage, and no one cared really because they thought she was in a costume. But what I found eerie about the article is she supposed she said to her fans who seen her like a lizard, ""Don't worry, I'm one of the good ones."" So I'm like, ""Why is the website now on the info got a big stamp with FALSE written like you needed to know that specifically?"" Just like the crazy teacher from Incredibles film goes, ""Coincidence? I think not!"" Was my brain at that point. After that, I just learned about the reptilians thanks to lots of smart people discussing on here and the obvious low-level toxic mind games people attempt to dismiss the entire subject as very noticeable, like they are in on it, but that was likely bots or people just with no intellectual thoughts so trolls basically. 

Currently, though, I see the UK government being run by the most obvious reptile, Rishi Sunak, the big annoying psyops that feeds on your soul, as in mental energy, same with US President Biden that is obviously a clone or something is odd with that dude anyway. I heard Biden died, and his brother took his spot, but that's a different conspiracy that goes mad. I'm just spitballing now; Kanye West feels like a psyops, especially after he went missing and mentioned they controlled him before he went missing. The royals are the most obvious too; you just can't miss that psyops, and I believe they got Diana as they knew it would be a feast of energy they feed on, but hey, that's just a theory! A reptile theory!"

Many people are assuming he'll be more active here than at PBC. The key name at 147 appears to be Conor Benn, who likely can't fight in the UK - thus needs a big US name (Hearn may also see this as cashing out, with Boots having a higher ceiling). 

However, we also know that Devin Haney rehydrated to like 165lbs for his 140lb fight against Regis Prograis. Devin is fighting Garcia, and may someday fight Lopez and Matias, but after that... Could he move up to 147 sooner than expected?

Haney-Ennis would be one the highest level US fights that Matchroom has ever promoted. I'm curious if Matchroom could end up in a similar spot to what PBC had in 147, with Spence, Porter, Ugas & Garcia. 

What do you think?"
2024-04-11 14:57:52,Friend forgot their railcard for a train almost a year ago. Now expected to pay £550 in five days with zero prior notice.,1,1c1h6yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1c1h6yj/friend_forgot_their_railcard_for_a_train_almost_a/,3,1712847472.0,"Never thought I'd be posting in a place like this but I'm so pissed off for my friend right now and need as much information I can get on this to help, because this doesn't seem right at all.

As the title says, they paid for their ticket (I think Trans-Pennine) under a railcard which they couldn't present, a small journey which would've only skived them out of £5. (I know this isn't the rules for a penalty fare, but they have email proof of owning one). Conductor asked them for their details and could only remember him saying the rail would 'contact them and sort something out'. They never got anything back from them. No letter, no 21 day reminder email, nothing. 

In the situation of my friend who has hardship funds in place of the uni they're studying at, it would be pretty fair for them to assume the rail's let them off since they've been silent about it. Additionally, they are registered disabled. Ten months later they get a Magistrate's court fine in the post from Marston, asking them to pay £550 in five days, or face the usual baliff bollocks where they start confiscating. From what I've heard from my friend, citizens advice and Marston's said there's nothing they can do to cancel, or even lower the fine (even though it was due to a LOT of negligence on their part), and the absolute best they get is to have to set up a payment plan to pay the entire thing over 12 months. 

This fine goes so far against their policy on treating people in situations like my friend's, according to this page: [https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/](https://marstonholdings.co.uk/high-court-enforcement/debt-advice/) \- specifically the parts about a fine this large having a strong financial impact on them (their family lives on the poverty line), and the fact that they are given only five days to pay it.

This whole thing sounds incredibly predatory and mishandled and I feel like there must be something more to investigate about this. I know there's a lot of ambiguity in proving that no contact was sent prior, but supposing that there absolutely wasn't anything, what would be the outcome from there? 

Please lmk if there's anything else important to note because I am trying to keep this as anonymous as possible out of respect for my friend, who is naturally pretty fucking terrified right now.  TY"

I (26 M) am moving to the UK end of April from Spain. I have some money that I would like to start investing as well as an X amount per month as soon as the moving is done. I have never invested before and I am a bit lost of how moving countries could impact it. So let me bullet point my questions to make it easier:

- Can I start investing while in Spain and then continue in UK? Do brokers usually allow this or would I have to sell everything and buy again?
- A friend of mine who also lived in the UK told me that what he did is having his address still in Spain while living there, so he was technically investing from here. This was before Brexit. Is this legal and recommended? I thought having the visa and working there invalidates my current living address in Spain
- I do plan to stay in UK couple years and then most likely move around Europe until, at some point, going back to Spain (but who knows, maybe I stay in UK my whole live). Considering this, are ISAs still a valid approach? They have good tax benefits but if I retrieve the money while in another country I would get taxed normally and I could not keep adding money there. It seems that if I move, start an ISA and then in two years I leave I would have to sell stocks and buy them again, which sounds bad… (?). 
- Having all this in mind, what broker would you use? People have recommended me Vanguard, Fidelity, MyInvestor and even some banks. My plan is 95% index funds and maybe couple stocks just to try

Thanks guys! Appreciate your help"

It's supposed to be a review on how the uk handles trans kids and adolescence in light of the recent Bell v Tavistock case. The problem is Dr Hilary Cass has a clear prejudice that she pours into her work and gets approval from other abhorrent people such as the PM Rishi Sunak or JK Rowling. The biggest fear I have with it is that its already making a difference, there are already calls for several NHS GIC's to close and reevaluate how they interact with patient care for trans youths. Its genuinely concerning because it doesn't just pick out trams children, but now anyone under 25. We're slipping down this hill straight into the jaws of a genocide and it's terrorfying.

When reading the review, it paints itself put to be a review designed to protect kids. It then goes on to say we don't know enough about puberty blockers to deem them safe (despite the fact that we do and still perscribe them to cis kids). Like it straight up ignores 50 years of reaserch on something that has been proven safe and is still administerd other children in a similar vein. It goes on to talk about how the human brain isn't fully developed until you're 25, so we should make the system harder for people under 25 to prevent any mistakes. Like this just blatantly ignores the fact that medical gac has one of the lowest regret rates out there and is extremely successful.

It says to look for external factors like ADHD or Autism, like either of thoes would change the gender incongruence?? Like yeah, lots of trans people are neurdivergent, but that changes nothing since u can't ""cure"" neurdivergence and gac is still proven to work ridiculously well in helping trans people, regardless of neurological wiring. Then it claims that, because of bullying and transphobia, kids should be discouraged from socially transitioning. ""Hey kids, are you sick of being bullied?? Well why don't you change your name and build a new life for yourself!"" Like are you seriously gonna victim blame on an actual medical report like it isn't people like YOU (Dr Hilary Cass) who encourage that bullying and transphobia!

Even ignoring all of that, it still takes seriously concerns that pretty much all major Western medical organisations know to be false. Like the idea that trans kids don't exist. The document that is supposed to be helping trans kids, humouring the idea that they don't exist. It's such a translucent exercise of cis-superiority that would be generous to imply arrogance and alleviate any malice intent from the equation. It gives a platform to bigots to stand on ""don't believe me, well in section 12:14 of the Cass Review it clearly states...(some dribble about social transitioning being wrong)."" I saw a tweet from a JK Rowling fan saying that the cast need to apologise to her for their remarks in support of the trans community and she responded (roughly) ""I wouldn't accept it."" THEY WERE RIGHT!! JK deserves no apology from anyone, but now she has a government approved document to validate her bigotry.

What scariest of all is how close we are to being a genuinely unsafe country for trans people. How many kids are gonna kill themselves because of this review? How many people are going to be assaulted and beaten up because of this document?? Last time rishi made a joke about trans people hate crime towards trans people took a significant rise in the UK, I dread to see what's gonna happen because of this. "

I am under the impression that I can upload the confirmation email I received for the Police Certificate rather than the certificate itself and this will act as a substitute until my certificate arrives.

So I have a couple of questions:

1. Is my understanding correct regarding the confirmation email?
2. Should I wait until the nearer my deadline in the hope of getting my Police Certificate early, or should I submit everything as soon as possible along with the confirmation email?
3. Will my currently uploaded documents be checked for validity before they're submitted?

Would also love to know about any swaps you guys would recommend. 

AM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

Then, I alternate between

2. NIOD GHKCU - Keen for a more potent version of this 

Or

3. Timeless 20% Vitamin C Ferulic Acid Vitamin C – When I used TO vitamin C powder at night I used to see a wee difference in my complextion when I woke up but with this I don’t so wondering if anyone can recommend something better that isnt TO- as I didnt like the texture and cba with the mixing.

4. La Roche Psay Invisible fluid - guess this is fine for now but would love to know of tinted sun creams that are good for pale, cool undertoned skin. 

 PM: 

1. TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 

5. Dermatica tretinoin 0.015%/Niacinamide 4% Azelaic Acid 4% Every second night with 1 weeks break before and after microneedling 

On the nights I am not using Tret I use the 2. NIOD or 3. Timeless depending on what I used in the morning 

5. Dermatica ceramide and peptide moisturiser - keen to swap this out as it seems over priced for what it is 

Once a week or once every fortnight a TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution depending on microneedling healing stage 

Microneedle approx once a month following the Pen Smit protocol 

Concerns in order of priority:

Pinkish, purple under eye circles which are often puffy, particularly on the right side. I’ve had these for as long as I can remember and am almost accepting that blepharoplasty is probably the only intervention that will remove them. Until I can afford surgery ( I live I the UK) I really hope that microneedling and RLT help reduce them and think I should also look into whether underlying health issues or allergys could be contributing to them but find it quite overwhelming and not really sure where best to start, what tests to prioritse, how long I would have to exclude something or say, take allergy meds to know… Wow they really get me down like I look SO sick and I dream of feeling comfortable make up free. 

Redness under nose, like a pink moustache that isnt particularly textured beyond what you would expect from spots. Have had this for as long as I can remember, wonder if it is from blowing my nose in the cold frequently (used to skate) or from a steroid cream I v vaguely remember being prescribed something.

General uneven looking complexion – blotchy, spots take ages to fade and up close you can see that my skin is soooo congested, I have white heads, black heads, pustules pretty much everywhere apart from my jaw. Possibly mild rosacea type 2 which might be why I randomly got blepharitus which is now reacurring. Not figured that out yet, god so much is up! Though I came for product recommendations I am also wondering if there are there any Derms or aestheticians that would let me DM them some photos? I feel like I need to show my face in its entirety both up close and selfie distance in various lights to get a good idea of what my skin is like and some features I have are pretty identifiable and though the changes are slim I would be mortified if someone I know saw them.

&#x200B;

Anyway, back to the main reason I am posting - 

 I was considering these products linked below which are a bit out of budget and not easy to get hold of as I am not US based and got stuck on whether the added kojic acid and alpha arbutin in [Brightening Tranexamic Acid Treatment – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/multi-bright-tranexamic-acid-treatment-5?_pos=1&_sid=0bb9e1337&_ss=r) would be an issue with GHKCU and the Tret 

and then when I considered  [Tranexamic Acid Serum – Naturium](https://naturium.com/products/tranexamic-topical-acid-5?_pos=2&_sid=8227fd551&_ss=r)  with the added kojic acid and niacinamide gathered that I couldnt use this with vitamin C but got stuck on whether it would be ok following GHKCU / Tret"

I am close to waiving the white flag. I'm not one to call on the Universe for signs, but it sure feels like I'm not meant for the UK.

**Timeline:**

* Route: Ancestry Visa
* (Canadian) via my Paternal Grandparents
* Applied: Feb 1
* Biometrics: Feb 6
* Email 1 for additional information: Feb 19
* Email 2 for additional information: March 4
* Email 3 for additional information: March 18
* **Final decision refusal: March 28**
* Complaint submitted: April 2
* **Complaint not upheld: April 11**

**Refusal: ""***As above you did not respond to our emails requesting further information and you have not provided sufficient evidence that confirms the UK Ancestry link to your claimed grandparent.*""

**Birth Certificate:**

The letter states that I provided my ""Paternal Grandfathers death certificate."" 

I did not provide my grandfather's death certificate. The document is my father's birth certificate, whose middle name is my grandfather's first name. So I wondered if, at a quick glance, the assumption was that this document was of my grandfather. There is a deceased watermark on the document. I wonder if that, coupled with the similar names, resulted in a mixup. 

I will add that this document also clearly shows the names of my father's parents and has a large ""Birth Certificate"" title at the top. Not Death Certificate.

&#x200B;

**No Communication:**

In the emails asking for additional information, it was never mentioned that I provided my grandfather's death certificate. Only that they were not satisfied that I had provided enough evidence of an ancestral link. So, I assumed the original Birth Certificate was not sufficient. Thus, I gathered additional documents: **Act of Birth (long-form birth certificate),  Birth Certificate (original that I submitted), Baptismal Papers and my Grandparent's Marriage Certificate.**

The letter states that no communication was received in their attempts to follow up with me. This is untrue. I responded with the documents on the following dates:

**Email 1: March 1**

I sent an email to: [WorkNonSponsored.DocsRequested@fco.gov.uk](mailto:WorkNonSponsored.DocsRequested@fco.gov.uk) and received a confirmation auto-response of receipt.

**Email 2: March 24**

In response to an email stating that they still haven't heard from me, I replied to the email directly with the same information as provided on March 1. 

&#x200B;

**Complaint:** 

**April 2:** I submitted a complaint through the online form and directly to: [complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk](mailto:complaints@homeoffice.gov.uk)

The form did not allow me to provide an attachment, so I emailed with a very clear timeline, my documents, screenshots of my emails, and proof that they were received with the auto-email confirmation.

**April 11: Complaint not upheld**

Is my only option to apply for an administrative review? I do not have the option of waiting for a year. I also submitted my application before the new IHS increase, so re-applying means I will be paying a lot more. 

What I find frustrating is no one has addressed my points. All this complaint email reply confirms is that I've been refused. I feel like I am being forced to pay for a review. At this point, I would almost be happy if someone truly looked at my application and stated that they are rejecting me based on all of my evidence. 

Any advice or honest feedback, especially if there is a step where I've gone wrong, is appreciated. Feeling quite defeated..."
